      <h3>Baphuon Temple</h3>
      <p>
        The Baphuon is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia. It is located in Angkor
        Thom, northwest of the Bayon. Built in the mid-11th century, it is a
        three-tiered temple mountain built as the state temple of
        Udayadityavarman II dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva. It is the
        archetype of the Baphuon style. The temple adjoins the southern
        enclosure of the royal palace and measures 120metres east-west by 100
        metres north-south at its base and stands 34 metres tall without its
        tower, which would have made it roughly 50 metres tall. Its appearance
        apparently impressed Emperor Chengzong of Yuan China's late 13thcentury
        envoy Chou Ta-Kuan during his visit from 1296 to 1297, who said it was
        'the Tower of Bronze...a truly astonishing spectacle, with more than ten
        chambers at its base.' In the late 15th century, the Baphuon was
        converted to a Buddhist temple. A 9 metres tall by 70 metres long statue
        of a reclining Buddha was built on the west side's second level, which
        probably required the demolition of the 8 metres tower above, thus
        explaining its current absence.

        The temple was built on land filled with sand, and due to its immense
        size of the site was unstable throughout its history. Large portions had
        probably already collapsed by the time the Buddha was added. Pen and
        watercolor reconstruction of what the temple may have looked in the 11th
        century by Lucien Fournereau in 1889. The unfinished reclining Buddha on
        the west side of the temple. By the 20th century, much of the temple had
        largely collapsed, and restoration efforts have since proven
        problematic: a first effort begun in 1960 was interrupted by the coming
        to power of the Khmer Rouge, and records of the positions of the stones
        were lost. A second attempt started in 1995 by a team of
        French-ledarcheologists as of 2005 was still ongoing, restricting
        visitor access. As of November 2010, partial visitor access was once
        again allowed, though not to the central structure. In April 2011, after
        51 years, the archaeologists finished the restoration of the temple.
        King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia and Prime Minister Francois Fillon of
        France were among those who first toured the renovated temple during the
        inauguration ceremony on July 3, 2011.
