      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Banteay Chhmar Temple was an ancient site in the Angkorian period
        (802-1432). It is located in Banteay Chhmar commune, Thma Puok district,
        Banteay Meanchey province, about 65-km north of Sisophon city, via Road
        Number 56. The site face the Dangrek Mountain chain at the north, and it
        is surrounded by four villages, namely Banteay Chhmar west, Bnateay
        Chhmar north, Banteay Chhmar south and Chrey, about 110-km from the
        Angkor World Heritage Site in Siem Reap province. It was situated
        strategically along the network of royal roads leading to the furthest
        northwest reaches of the territory controlled by Jayavarman VII (reigned
        c.1122-1218) during the Angkorian Empire. Recent surveys show that the
        site was continuously occupied from pre-historical times until now.
        <br /><br />
        The temple was situated at the heart of a new city located on a dry
        plain, requiring an elaborate hydrological system to bring water from
        the Dangrek Mountains to the north. To the east of the temple complex of
        Banteay Chhmar a rahal, or reservoir measuring 1.6 x 0.8 km was built,
        with a mebon, or artificial island at its centre. On the hill of this
        island today stands a crumbling sanctuary, surrounded by rice growing in
        the baray. <br />
        <br />
        Banteay Chhmar Temple is a large complex, with the main temple, built of
        grey sandstone, measuring 770 x 690 metres. The central complex of
        colonnaded galleries, measuring approximately 250 x 200 meters, enclosed
        five interconnected sanctuaries aligned along an east-west axis. The
        area included six artificial ponds or pools, two structures known as
        “libraries” and two elevated, terrace-platforms. This central core of
        the structure is surrounded by an expansive moat, 63 meters wide. The
        area outside the moat includes eight monuments that may have been
        hospital or monastery structures. Banteay Chhmar Temple was consecrated
        to the memory of Prince Srindrakumara, son or protégé of Jayavarman VII,
        and to four of the Prince’s companions in arms who had saved his life in
        battle against the Cham. The exquisitely rendered relief carvings of
        Banteay Chhmar depict scenes of battle on land and water between the
        Khmer and Cham, preparations for war, processions, royal audiences and a
        unique multi-armed Avalokiteśvara on the wall of western gallery.<br /><br />
        Banteay Chhmar was one of the most extensive architectural undertakings
        Jayavarman VII built in a politically sensitive region in the final
        years of his reign. The architecture shows signs of haste in its
        construction, as do his other temples, and it appears to have been left
        unfinished. There are clear indications that new architectural forms
        were still being developed at the site in the course of building. The
        iconography expresses both Buddhist and Hinduist beliefs, as well as the
        supremacy of the king, themes that are also represented in his other
        temples. However the representations of individual deities and their
        juxtapositions are in many cases unique to Banteay Chhmar. <br /><br />
        From the epigraphy that survives, however, it is clear that the temple
        was intended to be a major Mahāyāna institution in which the supremacy
        of Buddhism over both Hinduism and indigenous Khmer cults was strongly
        emphasized. The locations of the face-towers show that these structures
        were not erected exclusively above shrines of any particular cult, but
        uniformly above buildings belonging to all the religions that were
        practised in the temple. <br /><br />
        Some of the Mahāyāna reliefs suggest that the Buddhism of the time was
        undergoing internal development in Cambodia. But in broad outline
        Banteay Chhmar continued to represent the same mixture of religions for
        which Jayavarman’s earlier temples at Angkor had been built, with the
        peripheral inclusion of new forms of Lokeśvara. These forms were based
        on descriptions of Avalokiteśvara in Indian Sanskrit texts such as the
        Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra, which had been written in Kashmir in the 4th century
        CE, 800 years before Banteay Chhmar was built. Eight of these Lokeśvara
        images were depicted at Banteay Chhmar in the reliefs facing the sunset
        beside the western gatehouse of the third enclosure. <br /><br />
        In keeping with Jayavarman’s Khmerisation of religion, the indigenous
        cult of the transfiguration of the dead was also performed in numerous
        shrines of the central complex, a form of religion which had become a
        standard feature of all his temples. At Banteay Chhmar this cult was
        thoroughly organized, not in a vertical concentric arrangement as in the
        Bayon, but on a horizontal linear plan. This resulted in the
        architectural expansion of the sacred center from a single enclosure
        into three walled complexes joined together, which accounts for the
        extraordinary length of the principal enclosure. <br /><br />
        The importance of this cult of posthumous deification was powerfully
        expressed at Banteay Chhmar. The names of these immortalized
        individuals, and of the gods and goddesses who represented them
        posthumously, are given in the Khmer inscriptions. This is the context
        for the well-known Sanjak cult, which was practiced in the east complex,
        while members of royal families were deified in the center, and
        buddhicised Hindu and local deities were installed in the west complex.

      <h3>Justification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle</h3>
      <p>
        The temple of Banteay Chhmar is a unique complex of Angkorian period of
        structural style with the associated baray and water control systems,
        reflect outstanding aspects of architecture, engineering, arts, skilled
        craftsmanship, stone building, irrigation, governance and theology,
        landscape, human settlement and land use. However, a special feature of
        Banteay Chhmar temple is that in the middle on the island in the baray a
        sandstone sanctuary was erected, surrounded by a double moat. In the
        golden age, water was vital to the endurance of the Angkor’s
        civilization, and at Banteay Chhmar, uniquely the Dangrek Mountain acted
        as reservoirs. <br /><br />
        On the eastern side of Banteay Chhmar,was contructed a large artificial
        reservoir named Baray Mebon with a capacity of 2 million cubic metres.
        Water from the Dangrek Mountain flowed down natural canals to the Baray,
        and was used to irrigate the rice fields. The temple complex was
        designed to reflect Hindu theology and astrology. The main towers were
        built on the axis of four directions encircled with rectangular walls
        and galleries and surrounded by the moat, representing Mount Meru, home
        of Shiva and axis of the universe. The main temple bears four gates
        flanked with images of devata and giants holding the naga snake on the
        four main directions (east-west and north-south) representing the sacred
        Hindu universe. The urbanization of Banteay Chhmar brought to life a
        whole complex of communities in the surrounding area -- evidence as a
        great and enduring masterpiece of Angkorian art and architecture. All
        structures in the temple complex of Banteay Chhmar were built of
        sandstone and laterite of the highest quality. It was said that the
        quarried stone blocks were transported by rafts, elephants and carts to
        the location of the construction place. The techniques of stone masonry
        followed here involved placing roughly shapedstone blocks on top of each
        other from foundations to the top with, and then the stone was decorated
        in situ. Technically, the weight bearing of the stone elements for
        building construction was skillfully managed, leading to fine
        preservation over nine centuries, and making restoration feasible. Then,
        the master sculptors of the day embellished the temple complex with
        floral and human designs depicting scenes from the daily life, war
        between Khmer and Chams, religious events, churning of the sea of milk,
        local fighting, etc. <br /><br />
        Criterion (ii): It might be added up to the process of nomination, if
        there are sufficient supported evidences from more comprehensive
        researches and inventories that will be carried on later in an actual
        nomination process. <br /><br />
        Criterion (iii): The Banteay Chhmar complex is unique in the Angkorian
        world for its juxtaposition into a complete whole. The temple complex
        was selected for the construction of sacred monuments by the local elite
        lineage. Based upon the architectural and iconographical evidence, the
        temple complex was built during the end of 12th to early 13th centuries
        C.E in Bayon style of Angkor Civilization. The sanctuaries themselves
        represented kingdoms of deities, and comprisedmain face towers, walls,
        galleries, gopura with realistic stone carving depicting the Great Epics
        of Buddhist iconography (notably Lokeśvara), a processional walkway,
        ponds and reservoirs in a unified architectural plan. The iconographical
        forms of Lokeśvara were based on descriptions of Avalokiteśvara in
        Indian Sanskrit texts such as the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra, which had been
        written in Kashmir in the 4th–5th century CE. Eight of these Lokeśvara
        images were depicted here in the reliefs facing the sunset beside the
        western gatehouse of the third enclosure. This location clearly
        indicates the importance of Amitābha, Red Tathāgata of the West and
        spiritual father of Lokeśvara, the most popular of the Mahāyāna’s five
        transcendent Buddhas with his western paradise of Sukhāvatī. All these
        elements reflect the symbolic connection between the gods and humans.
        Scientifically, the sandstone material and laterite used for Banteay
        Chhmar and the stone carving is as beautiful as the Bayon Temple in the
        Angkor site in Siem Reap Province, and serve to form the unique and
        outstanding appearance of this tangible heritage complex in Banteay
        Meanchey Province. <br /><br />
        Criterion (iv): An outstanding example of a provincial city comprising
        an ensemble of sacred monuments and the associated artificial water
        control system that reflect outstanding aspects of architecture,
        engineering, irrigation, and landscape. Banteay Chhmar consists of
        several concentric enclosures. Each enclosure is surrounded by a wall.
        Modern archaeologists number these enclosures from the center outwards.
        The innermost and smallest enclosure is therefore always named Enclosure
        1. However, we approach the temple from the outside, of course,
        therefore from the outermost enclosure, and proceed inward. Banteay
        Chhmar has five enclosures. The outermost, fifth enclosure of the
        temple, bounded by earthworks, measures 2.2 by 1.7 kilometers and
        contains a large rectangular moat, 63 meters wide, surrounding the main
        temple buildings in an area of 770 by 690 metres. Between the earth
        rampart and the moat, four satellite temples are located in the cardinal
        directions. There is also an additional temple in the south, and one
        more in the southeast. So there are altogether six satellite temples
        inside the fifth enclosure. Outside the earth rampart stand two further
        axially-sited satellite temples, in the north and west. The original
        purpose of all these satellite temples is not known, because
        unfortunately they do not contain any inscriptions. The earth rampart is
        penetrated on its eastern side by a large rectangular artififical water
        reservoir or baray, known as the Rahal (1700 x 800 meters), which has an
        island-temple (mebon) at its center. The reservoir is bordered with
        laterite steps to facilitate the fetching of water, and at its western
        end there was a landing stage from which worshippers could cross to the
        temple on the island by boat. The waters of the moat are crossed by four
        axial causeways having balustrades in the form of statues of gods and
        demons pulling on Nāgas, as at Angkor Thom and Preah Khan at the Angkor
        site.

      <h3>Déclarations d’authenticité et/ou d’intégrité</h3>
      <p>
        The Banteay Chhmar site had been lost in the jungle for many years, and
        very few major restoration procedures have been applied to the site.
        Most of its ruins are still intact and in situ, revealing its
        authenticity as a whole. <br /><br />
        From 2005 untilthe present day, the Cambodian Ministry of Culture and
        Fine Arts has undertaken field archaeological studies, clearance,
        conservation and restoration of the Banteay Chhmar temple, funded by
        Royal Government and local donations. In 1998, 2000 and 2002, the World
        Monuments Fund , under its World Monuments Watch programme, cooperated
        with the Ministry to remove dangerous vegetation and to implement
        remedial measures to improve the stability of the remaining structures.
        From 2007 to 2012, the American Global Heritage Fund began collaboration
        with the Ministry in a Conservation Training Project, preparing a Master
        Conservation Plan for protection and preservation of the relief
        galleries and stabilization of the central temple complex.It was found
        that more than 95 percent of the architectural building materials of the
        main temple of Banteay Chhmar (including stone sanctuaries, galleries
        and walls) had collapsed on top of and and underground of parts of the
        building. Moreover, many of them had been looted and even destroyed .
        Some of these stone artefacts were able to be returned to their original
        position during restoration work. Many bas relief carving on the
        galleries’ walls still lie buried under the collapsed stone materials
        and very few items of the looted sculpture has been returned. Banteay
        Chhmar Cultural Heritage, the Ministry is protected under the Act on
        Ancient Monuments, Antiques, Objects of Arts, as amended in 6th January
        1996, and by the Royal Decree dated on11th March 2003. From the present
        state of knowledge relating Banteay Chhmar, its authenticity has been
        indicated through remaining attributes such as; form and design;
        materials and substance; location and setting. But since it lay long
        abandoned and ruined for hundreds of years, some of these many
        attributes are relatively weak and will require further research and
        definition, as for example; techniques and management systems; the use
        and function; traditions, language and other forms of intangible
        heritage; as well as spirit and feeling.a Since the Banteay Chhmar site
        and the main temple complex and the sattelite temples have not yet been
        fully investigated or restored, almost all of the ruins’ features are
        still intact in situ and many of them are unexplored, it can be
        concluded that most of the original attributes remain within the
        property. None are lost or have been significantly damaged.
      </p>
      <h3>Comparaison avec d’autres biens similaires</h3>
      <p>
        One unique feature of the Banteay Chhmar temple is the relief carving on
        the East Gallery Wall, of a series of extraordinary, images of
        multi-headed Avaloketdshvara Bodhisattvas, one bearing 32 arms. The
        relief carvings of this section of the gallery of the temple depict an
        array of remarkable Tantric Buddhist images, evidence of Banteay
        Chhmar’s significance as a sacred site for Buddhist practice.
        <br /><br />
        Banteay Chhmar was compared with twenty-three sites using not only the
        criteria under which these World Heritage sites were inscribed (Criteria
        (iii) (iv)), but also the attributes that are embodied in the national,
        regional, and universal value of Banteay Chhmar. Firstly, heritage sites
        in Southeast Asia were considered, followed by India, and other sites
        throughout the world. The primary focus was to compare and confirm the
        attributes representing the Universal Value of Banteay Chhmar with
        comparable sites throughout the world. Each historical/cultural site was
        evaluated against the physical and intrinsic attributes exhibited by
        Banteay Chhmar. These attributes include architecture, art, hydraulic
        systems, agriculture, religious affiliation, commerce and economic,
        social and political environment, special site attribute, subjective
        site condition, and urbanization as well as size and site chronology
        regardless of their categorization in World Heritage. The evaluation
        criteria measures sites which: The aim was to identify habitat complexes
        worldwide, preferably rural, which include a temple or religious
        monument, and appear to express Criteria (iii) and (iv)), defining the
        significant development of a low-density urban landscape occurring
        worldwide, but especially in Southeast Asia with a focus on the late
        12th early 13th century CE (Criterion (iv)). In this way, Banteay Chhmar
        was compared with important historical sites in Southeast Asia and Asia.
        Comparable sites currently inscribed on the World Heritage List that
        cover a similar development period but not necessarily the same time
        frame are Vat Phou, My Son Sanctuary, Prambanan Temple Complex, and the
        complexes of Beikthano-Myo, Halin, Sri Ksetra in Myanmar, and, currently
        on the tentative list, Angkor Borei and Phnom Da. The comparative sites
        exhibit a variety of elements, such as trading networks, religious
        affiliation, city-state development, and monumental art, which are
        shared with Banteay Chhmar, but lack the vital, substantial combination
        of urban complexity, spiritual significance, artistic innovation, and
        religious polity which Banteay Chhmar accomplished in less than a
        century. Some of the sites display hydraulic systems, however they
        encompass a far smaller area with substantially less monumental artistry
        and engineering then that displayed at Banteay Chhmar. While many sites
        contain artistic and architectural elements of note, only a few combine
        these with the hydraulic features incorporated into the religious and
        urban centre as found at the Banteay Chhmar. Banteay Chhmar bears unique
        testimony to the cultural values and artistic and architectural stylesof
        Southeast Asia in the late 12th early 13th century CE. Only My Son
        Sanctuary, and the heritage sites of Beikthano-Myo, Halin, and Sri
        Ksetra in Myanmar exhibit this to a similar extent. However, the
        monuments of the Myanmar serial sites effectively span nine centuries
        (1st-9th CE). The sites in Myanmar are Buddhist and do not exhibit the
        engagement with Hinduism elements as exemplified by My Son and Banteay
        Chhmar. Additionally, few sites in Asia exhibit the religious
        eclecticism and syncretism that is expressed in the religious arts of
        Buddhism, along with Animism, and Hinduism as at Banteay Chhmar. Other
        early Hindu/Buddhist sites in Southeast Asia, such as Angkor Borei,
        similarly lack extant architecture to the extent of Banteay Chhmar.
        Together with the statuary and decorative elements that comprise the
        distinctive “Bayon Style” and the important historical evidence
        contained in the site's inscriptions, the site preserves the most
        significant record of the artistic and architectural achievements,
        together with their associated religious and political elements, that
        emerged from the uptake and transformation of Buddhism during this
        period. Banteay Chhmar is a key example of the development of the
        agrarian-based, low-density urban landscape believed to lack adequate
        agrarian elements for long-term sustainability. This pattern of urban
        complex has been identified in three locations: Southeast Asia
        (Cambodia’s Khmer Empire) and Sri Lanka. The rise and fall of this type
        of urban formation is of international importance, particularly in
        understanding the relationships between urban planning and the
        environment. The Sri Lankan site is currently well-represented on the
        World Heritage List associated urban centres of the late 12th early 13th
        century CE. However, the development of the urban hydraulic complex in
        Southeast Asia is currently under-represented: of Southeast Asian
        cultural heritage sites on the World Heritage List, only the Myanmar
        city-state Pyu Ancient Cities and the Angkor Archaeological Park have
        habitat components dating to around this period. The economies
        represented by sites contemporaneous with Banteay Chhmar are
        substantially different: Vat Phou was a religious center for the most
        part with habitat components, while the Myanmar walled city-states of
        Pyu were primarily trading capitals. Banteay Chhmar must be considered
        alongside other urban formations in Southeast Asia, including those on
        the Cambodian Tentative List for World Heritage inscription, such as
        Beng Mealea and Preah Khan Kampong Svay, as well as other important
        sites. When compared to these other sites in Vietnam, Cambodia and
        Thailand, Banteay Chhmar stands out for its size, the quality of its
        extant architectural and artistic components, and the complexity of
        design. Again, many of the other early urban landscapes in Southeast
        Asia were city-states with their economic bases in trade, unlike Banteay
        Chhmar, with its emphasis on agriculture and religion as well as trade.
        Banteay Chhmar provides outstanding evidence of the evolution of the
        agrarian, low-density urban landscape in Southeast Asia, and the
        associated developments in the formation of the state and its supporting
        religious ideology. The habitat of Banteay Chhmar marked the appearance
        of a new kind of urban complex almost solely dedicated to the royal
        family and its extension of power and politics. Accompanying the
        habitation and temple complex zone was a substantial system of canals,
        moats, ponds and other water management features. Water management at
        the site would have been crucial, given that the region where Banteay
        Chhmar is situated is subject to annual fluctuations in water flow.
        Scholars have designated such examples of Angorian-era monumental
        complexes including extensive water management systems as “theocratic
        hydraulics”, arguing that their primary purpose was to ensure a supply
        of water for temple ponds, baray and moats. At Banteay Chhmar, the
        technology for large-scale water management certainly existed, but may
        have been directed towards other secular purposes, including transport,
        town water supply, and defence against periodic inundation. Banteay
        Chhmar is a site of immense historical importance. There is currently no
        site on the World Heritage List, tentative list, or as yet identified
        that exhibits the unique combination of a religious building complex and
        art from this period that are accompanied by a sizeable urban complex
        with the hydraulic and agricultural features of a polity that is found
        at Banteay Chhmar. <br /><br />
        Banteay Chhmar can be compared to World Heritage sites, Tentative Listed
        sites and others within the Kingdom of Cambodia. Based on the
        architectural and engineering style, belief, faith arts and site
        location the Angkor Archaeological Park is comparative in all aspects
        while Sambor Prei Kuk has a similar hydraulic system, although from
        centuries earlier. Sites on the Tentative List as Beng Mealea, and Preah
        Khan Kampong Svay are also contain aspects identical to those noted at
        Banteay Chhmar.
