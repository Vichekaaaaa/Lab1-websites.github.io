      <h3>
        Temple Zone of Sambor Prei Kuk
      </h3>
      <p>
        The archaeological site of Sambor Prei Kuk, “the temple in the richness
        of the forest” in the Khmer language, has been identified as Ishanapura,
        the capital of the Chenla Empire that flourished in the late 6th and
        early 7th centuries AD. The property comprises more than a hundred
        temples, ten of which are octagonal, unique specimens of their genre in
        South-East Asia. Decorated sandstone elements in the site are
        characteristic of the pre-Angkor decorative idiom, known as the Sambor
        Prei Kuk Style. Some of these elements, including lintels, pediments and
        colonnades, are true masterpieces. The art and architecture developed
        here became models for other parts of the region and lay the ground for
        the unique Khmer style of the Angkor period.

      <h3>Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis</h3>
      <p>
        Sambor Prei Kuk Temple Zone is part of the remains of ancient Ishanapura
        "the temple in the lush forest", which was the capital of the Chenla
        Empire that flourished over much of Southeast Asia in the late 6th and
        early 7th centuries AD, and whose architectural achievements laid the
        foundations for those of the later Khmer Empire. The extensive Temple
        Zone of 840 hectares lies to the east of the remains of the moated city
        and is linked to the river Stung Sen and a possible harbour of
        Ishanapura by three earthen causeways between 600 and 700 metres in
        length. <br /><br />
        Within the Temple Zone, an outstanding ensemble of 186 fired brick
        temples with sandstone detailing reflects the introduction of technical
        and spiritual ideas of the Hindu Hariharan and Sakabrahmana cults from
        India and Persia respectively and the resulting convergence of these
        with animist and Buddhist elements that produced the unique Sambor Prei
        Kuk artistic style, which later heralded the Khmer style developed in
        Angkor. Inscriptions in Sanskrit and old Khmer on some of the temples
        reflect the adoption of a “God-King” in the centralized state, while
        others record temple activities, the names of kings and other
        individuals, details of religious and political life, and suggest the
        overall boundaries of the empire. The temple reliefs are the first signs
        of visual narratives in temple decoration which go beyond the earlier
        standard heraldic displays of deities in small medallions or small
        figures riding mythological animals. <br /><br />
        There are three main temple complexes of Prasat Yeai (Southern Group),
        Prasat Tao (Central Group), Prasat Sambor (Northern Group, including the
        Prasat Sandan Group and Prasat Bos Ream). Each has a central tower on a
        raised platform surrounded by smaller towers and other structures, and
        are enclosed by square brick and/or laterite walls, two for the central
        and south groups but three for the Prasat Sambor complex with each outer
        wall extending to 389 metres. These three groups contain 125 individual
        temples with 46 other temples and structures in the surrounding area
        including the Prasat Trapeang Ropeak and Prasat Kuok Troung groups. To
        the north, a satellite zone of 16 temples in the Prasat Srei Krup Leak
        and Prasat Robang Romeas groups display the architectural transition
        from the earlier Zhenla (Chenla) architectural style to that of Sambor
        Prei Kuk. In this area extensive archaeology layers built upon each
        other remain to be uncovered. <br /><br />
        The temples are constructed in a variety of shapes, configurations, and
        sizes, but of special note are 11 octagonal temples, designed in
        accordance with the general principles of the ancient Indian Manuals of
        Architecture, (although with no known Indian precedent). These are seen
        to represent the flying octagonal palace of Indra or Vimana Trivishtapa,
        the heaven of Indra and of 33 gods. The outside walls are decorated with
        Hindu iconography, and in six temples there are exquisite sculptural
        depictions of flying palaces. <br /><br />
        The extensive ensemble of religious buildings and their ancillary
        structures together with 102 hydraulic features display achievements in
        planning, technical ingenuity, execution, and resource management not
        previously seen in Southeast Asia. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (ii):</strong> The Sambor Prei Kuk architectural and
        artistic style of the Temple Zone of Ishanapura, as exemplified in the
        layout, architectural forms and sculptured reflects on 186 fired bricks
        temples with sandstone detailing, presents a vivid convergence of
        spiritual and technical influences between Hindu cults predominantly
        from India and Persia and elements of animism and Buddhism, which became
        a model that spread to other parts of the region and eventually led to
        the crystallization of the unique Khmer style of the Angkorian period.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iii):</strong> The Temple Zone of Sambor Prei Kuk of
        Ancient Ishanapura, in terms of the scale and scope of its surviving
        buildings and watercourses, is an outstanding testimony to the cultural
        traditions of the Chenla Kingdom, which flourished over much of
        Southeast Asia in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD, and whose
        architectural achievements laid the foundations for those of the later
        Khmer civilization in the Angkorian period. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (vi):</strong> The temple inscriptions in the Khmer
        language of the Temple Zone of Sambor Prei Kuk reflect the concept of
        the God-King, which according to legends originated in Vat Phou, was
        further developed during the Angkor period, and then much later
        influenced Thailand’s four pillared administrative system in Ayutthaya.
        It remained a concept that was fundamental to the political and
        governance systems of Cambodia and Thailand until the beginning of the
        20th century. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <h4>Integrity</h4>
      <p>
        The property covers the Temple Zone of Sambor Prei Kuk and its entire
        surroundings together with the wooded area that is the origin of the
        site's current name. All the still-standing buildings, most of the known
        remains of the hydraulic elements, all causeways and all the currently
        known temples and areas identified as holding further of archaeological
        remains of temples are contained within the boundaries. <br /><br />
        The Temples zone has suffered from the ravages of time, vagaries of
        climate and recent historical events as well as forest encroachment, all
        of which have led to the degradation of some monuments. Over time, parts
        of the monuments and objects belonging to the temples have been moved
        and/or looted. However, the main disaster was the international conflict
        that placed Cambodia in a war zone from the late 1960s to the early
        1990s. Despite these tragic events, the major temples retain their
        original form and materials, despite repairs and modifications carried
        out from the 7th to the 11th century. Although a number of decorative
        elements, statues, and inscriptions remain in situ, most of the
        important sculptural masterpieces are in storage or exhibited in
        museums. Archaeological surveys have indicated that many of the buried
        structures are in good condition. The system of dykes, canals, and
        hydraulic features, numbering 102 sites, are intact, with many still in
        use today.
      </p>
      <h4>Authenticity</h4>
      <p>
        Despite decay, the still-standing temples display authenticity in form
        and design and demonstrate Indian cultural and architectural influence
        during the Chenla period in a unique Sambor Prei Kuk Style. In terms of
        materials, the remnant features retain their original substance because
        of sympathetic restoration to damaged brickwork that continues
        traditional techniques and the use of old bricks. This helps maintain
        the authenticity of form, function, and visual qualities. In addition,
        and by comparison with Angkor, there have been relatively fewer physical
        interventions and no hypothetical reconstruction. Minor reconstruction
        activity has occurred in some temples, but mainly to ensure structural
        stability and all restoration interventions are reversible. Many other
        temple remains are highly vulnerable and await consolidation and
        conservation.
      </p>
      <h4>Protection and management requirements</h4>
      <p>
        The Temple Zone of Sambor Prei Kuk, archaeological site of ancient
        Ishanapura and buffer zone is protected by the Royal Decree of 24
        December 2014 and by the Law on the Protection of Cultural Heritage
        (Royal decision NS/RKM/0196/26 dated 25 January 1996). Within this
        framework, the National Authority for Sambor Prei Kuk (NASPK) is
        responsible for the overall management of the property and its buffer
        zone, including conservation, protection, restoration, development
        activities in progress, as well as for the interpretation of its
        heritage values for visitors. Work is guided by a Management Plan.
        Conservation activities are carried out in accordance with a
        fifteen-year Conservation Plan, based on a detailed risk analysis of the
        temples, and in accordance with a Conservation Manual that delineates
        conservation approaches for the highly fragile temples and their
        sensitive surroundings. <br /><br />
        NASPK is supported by a local NGO, "The Conservation and Development
        Community for Sambor Prei Kuk", established in 2004 with the agreement
        of the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, which has played a crucial
        role in the sustainable conservation of cultural heritage and in
        developing engagement with the local community.
