      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Oudong was an ancient city of the post-Angkorian period (1618-1863 C.E),
        located in present-day Psadek commune, Punhea Loeu district, Kandal
        province, about 35 km Northwest of Phnom Penh city via National Road
        Number 5. The city faces Kampong Loung village and Tonle Sap river on
        the east, Vang Chas village and Oudong market in the north, National
        Road Number 5 on the south, and its southwest side faces Prasith
        mountain. It is approximately 10Km away from another post-Angkorian city
        of Longvek. <br /><br />
        The city remains are near a distinctive mountain called Phnom Oudong
        (Oudong Mountain) and consist of many archaeological findings left from
        Pre-Angkor, Angkor and Post-Angkorian periods such as sandstone
        architectural elements and artefacts resulting from the worship of
        Animism, Hindusim, Mahayana Buddhism, and Theravada Buddhism. Those
        artefacts include the laterite foundations, door set elements of the
        ancient temple, the statue of Nandin and Buddha on Naga, the house of
        Neak Ta and spirits, and an Islamic vihara. Additionally, a great
        Artharush Vihara and Maravijjaya Buddha are on the lower peak of the
        mountain. Importantly, the site contains 16 stupas of earlier Theravada
        Buddhist Kings and the Royal family of the Oudong period, of which13 are
        on the mountain, and 3 are at the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />
        Recent LiDAR images reveal that the ancient Oudong city covered a large
        area, with Oudong mountian forming the point with construction in to all
        four cardinal directions. A remarkable settlement was located around the
        Royal Port (Kampong Loung) on the Tonle Sap river that connects to the
        ancient city of Longvek. Many significant names in the area still used
        today clearly trace the infrastructure and management plan of the city.
        For instance, Srah (pond) Sarpeyuth, Srah Dhammakerti, Vang Chas (old
        palace), Vihear Loung (royal vihara), Vat Knong Vang (the pagoda located
        in royal palace), Preah Sre (royal rice field), Khlang Sbek (leather
        storage), Psa Dek village (blacksmith village), Cham village. In
        addition, archaeological research shows a large and important iron kiln
        located in the city (Boeung Samrith area, close to Oudong Mountain).
      </p>
      <h3>Justification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle</h3>
      <p>
        oday Oudong is well-known as a tourist attraction site due to its
        historical background as an ancient city of the post-Angkorian period,
        and persistent religious and cult beliefs maintain the mystical sacred
        aspect of the site. <br /><br />
        Oudong city flourished from the early 17th century to the mid-19th
        century CE on a site that had been important in the early periods of
        Longvek, whose Ang Chand established many religious foundations on
        Oudong mountain and the area nearby. The construction of an image of
        Buddha attaining Nirvana on the lower peak of the mountain is an
        example. Also, he built many pagodas and Buddhist viharas, such as the
        Vihara of Vat Tep Pranam. The site continued to be occupied and icn 1618
        C.E, King Jayajetha II established his capital in Oudong. The choice of
        this location was closely related to the model of construction of cities
        in the history of Cambodia, referringback to the Angkor period and
        forward to Phnom Penh city. The location was selected firstly based on
        the proximate mountain (Oudong mountain, used as a sacred mountain for
        the Kingdom and also the central point for urban planning). Secondly,
        one side of the city faces and is close to the river or water (Tonle
        Sap), which served religious needs and also was gateway for different
        products trade goods and cultural items. The location and the city area
        of Oudong could be described as a political centre, trading centre, and
        religious / cultural centre. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (ii):</strong> Political Centre: Oudong city was
        established about 10 km from the previous capital city, Longvek
        (1528-1594 C.E), which used some locations in Oudong to build
        significant religious structures. Later, in the early 17th century, King
        Jayajetha II chose to build his capital city in Oudong, making it as the
        main political centre of the Kingdom. According to historical records of
        the Portuguese the urban planning of Oudong city was well managed and
        organized. Some wooden houses were built in a straight horizontal and
        vertical lines, one next to another with significant shape and style.
        They were described as looking clean and comfortable, while other houses
        were not built following the straight line, but the shape and style were
        similar. These houses were scattered both on the flat area next to the
        rice fields and also along the river. Roads provided easy access to the
        villages and facilitated local transportation inside the city which is
        mainly the oxcart. Further from the houses, the Royal Palace of Oudong
        was also well constructed. It was built almost in a square shape,
        surrounded by a strong wall, with the main entrance to the south and
        smaller gates on the other sides. Before entering the complex area of
        the Royal Palace, there is a control post and also another wall. The
        compound of the palace had two big basins, a garden, a great hall,
        residential quarters of the King of Particular note, the capital city of
        Oudong was also not only the residence for Cambodians, but was also open
        to multiple nationalities with village enclaves specifically designated
        for Chinese, Cham (probably Java), Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch
        and others. Until today, some of these foreign villages are still
        recognisable through archaeological findings and foreign records or
        through the name of the villages and some distinct jobs and professions
        such as blacksmith, gold, silver, copper and iron smiths and ceramic
        kilns were also found. Recent excavation shows that Beoung Samrith,
        located near Oudong mountain was a large iron kiln. This kiln is
        suggested to be a biggest iron kiln the Southeast Asia at that time.
        Contemporary reports mention that the city had other important
        buildings, such as pagodas, prayer halls and many storage facilities,
        but did not clearly mentioned other facilities such as schools and
        hospitals. However, it is also well-known that in those days pagodas
        functioned as the places for education. Therefore, the ancient city of
        Oudong was composed of different infrastructures and facilities to
        provide and support a political centre for both local and also
        foreigners through a well-constructed administrative infrastructure, and
        a strong ability to produce significant products. Commerce / Trading
        Center: Cambodia is well-known as a source of good rice. However, rice
        was not the only significant product to be found in Oudong city, but
        there were many other products which originated from other countries in
        Southeast Asia and also Europe. The port of Oudong city was located in
        the area of present day Kampong Loung (Royal Port), which still houses
        many workshops of blacksmiths and artisans, especially working in silver
        of high quality and reputation, in traditional designs passed down from
        their ancestors, which are still today sought by royal and wealthy
        clients. According to some foreign records such as Portuguese and Dutch,
        and also the documentation from Cambodian Royal Chronicles, Cambodia in
        the post-Angkorian, mainly Oudong, period based its economy on trade
        with the counties in both Asia and Europe, such as India, China, Japan,
        Portuguese, Holland and also England, and this trade made Oudong city
        became the residence of those foreigners. Oudong city was considered an
        important port in Southeast Asia for trade in raw silk, rice, lacquer,
        animal skins and horns, ivory, bee wax, honey, alum and iron ore.
        Furthermore, there were also products from the highland areas such as
        natural resin (benjamin) and gum. Additionally, crops, vegetables and
        fruits, were available for trade. Products from Cambodia were described
        as being of high quality and were bought in large amounts, mainly by
        Chinese and Japanese. For instance, its pepper was highly prized; “a
        ship of peppercorns were easily sold in a short time” (Bassett, 1962).
        Thus, Oudong city was administrated as an important city through
        providing good and large amounts of natural products from its port to
        Asia and also Europe in the Oudong period. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iv):</strong> Religious Centre: In the Oudong period,
        the main religion was Theravada Buddhism. However, contemporary
        religious structures and artefacts found on the site especially on
        Oudong Mountain, show that the people believed not only in Theravada
        Buddhism, but also Animism, Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism and Islam.
        Regarding Animism, it is important to know that Oudong Mountain itself
        has a spirit according to local legend, and is the place of many local
        spirits and deities (Neak Ta). Believers especially the local people,
        pay high respect to the spirits there., particularly to request kitchen
        utensils to use during a celebration ceremony or marriage, or help on
        any health issue and happiness. Traces of Hinduism can be seen in many
        remaining artefacts such as the statue of Nandin, while traces of
        Mahayana Buddhism are seen in the statue of Buddha on Naga, which is
        dated to the Angkor period. A substantial number of religious buidings
        and statues were dedicated to Thereavada Buddhism, such as the reclining
        Buddha, Maravijaya Buddha, Buddhist viharas and also stupas, and
        interestingly, an Islamic mosque was also constructed on Oudong
        mountain. Most of the religious places have been worshipped before
        Oudong Mountain became a sacred place for Oudong city. Also, there is a
        continuity of installing the stupas of the Kings and Royal family on the
        mountain since the early period of Oudong until the present day. Since
        Oudong has been selected as a sacred mountain, one can note the absence
        of any dwelling, warehouse or treasure vault. Power came from capital
        accumulated by the dynastic funerary vestiges, the stupa themselves, and
        through them the King,who represents the pantheon . Also, it may be
        surmised that the mountain housed the royal chapel, in continuation of
        the Angkorian experience in which a temple-mountain was surmounted by a
        tower-sanctuary hosting the statues of the ancestors. Among the 16
        stupas we can see two principal types : decorated (Chetei Trong Kreoung)
        and non-decorated (Chetei Moul / Cheteik Leat). “Cheti Trong Kreoung” is
        a type of stupa that is decorated with a kind of silk textile motif.
        Distinctively, this type of stupa usually is built on a square plan and
        every corner is designed to have multiple levels. It has full
        decoration, starting from the bottom to the top. It is clear to see this
        type of design on the stupa of Preah Ang Doung. Particularly, the stupa
        of Preah Ang Doung has very beautiful motifs made of different glazed
        ceramics. Some of those patterns subseuently deteriorated or collapsed,
        but were restored continuously by the following kings. Another unique
        design is the figure of elephant heads surrounding the lower part of the
        stupa. This type of design is very rare in Cambodia. Such decoration of
        elephant heads on stupas were firstly found in Sri Lanka and later
        adopted by many Buddhist countries in Southeast Asia. “Chetei Moul” or
        rounded stupa can be called a bell-shaped stupa. It has a bell shape at
        the bottom part and gets smaller when coming to the top. It has minimal
        design, and is known to be the earliest type of stupa, invented in
        Sri-Lanka, and corresponding to the shape of the alms bowl of the Buddha
        Gotama Another significant point is the worship of Cham (Java) people
        who are living around Longvek city (Tra Lengkeng area). Every year, Cham
        people who live in the area of the former Longvek city come to worship
        on Oudong mountain. Significantly, their offerings closely resembled to
        Cambodian.

      <h3>Déclarations d’authenticité et/ou d’intégrité</h3>
      <p>
        oday, the active Oudong ancient city is gone. However, beside schooling
        Oudong ancient city is well-known and telling to the younger generation.
        The memory of elderlies, the name of the places, and also the remaining
        heritages on the site are the most fascinate and lives source to know
        and see how great Oudong city was. There is no new construction of the
        stupa on Oudong mountain, but still the relics of the Royal members are
        inserted into the stupas of their ancestors on this mountain. Also, in
        2004, King Norodom Sihanouk built a large and stunning stupa for the
        relic of Gotama Buddha on the site. Therefore, the belief in the
        importance of the site is undeniably connected to the people, especially
        the local people and the people from the ancient city of the Longvek and
        the royal family of Cambodia. Oudong ancient city is under the
        management and protection from the Ministry of Culture and Fine Art,
        Cambodia. The protecting zone was made under the survey and studies.
        Furthermore, it is strongly prohibited to change the original state of
        the site. The conservation and restoration have been applying to some
        historical buildings and artefacts on Oudong Mountain. Importantly, the
        Ministry of Culture and Fine Art is working very closely with the local
        people who are living and benefiting the site in order to find a proper
        solution for both the heritage and the people.

        1. NATIONAL Phnom Penh city (Chaktomuk) (Cambodia: 15th and 20th century
        up to the present): The traditional Cambodian model for a city from
        Angkorian times is to be built in a location where there is one side
        opens to the river and another side has the mountain. Notably, in Phnom
        Penh we find the junction and re-splitting of two rivers (Mekong and
        Tonle Sap merging and separating again into Mekong and Bassac), hence
        the name Chaktomuk - four faces, in French quatre-bras, but there is no
        natural mountain in the area and an artificial mountain (Wat Phnom)
        serves this symbolic function so. Although the city known as Chaktomuk
        is said to have been founded in 1372, it became briefly the capital of
        Cambodia (from 1432 to 1505), but the river and the port continued to be
        an important place for exchange and trade both domestically and also
        abroad, and some small foreign communities, including Portuguese, Dutch
        and Japanese are known to have remained, until in 1866 King Ang Duong
        moved the court from Oudong to re-establish his capital to be known as
        Phnom Penh, as it is today, with the Royal Palace at the Chaktomuk
        junction, still regarded as the symbolic heart of the country. Longvek
        city (Cambodia: 16th century C.E.) : Longvek was also an important city
        of post-Angkorian period. The complex of urban planning has not yet been
        fully revealed, although its extent was revealed in recent LiDAR
        surveys. This city was also established between Tonle Sap Oudong
        mountain. Remains of religious buildings and icons show evidence of this
        the early culture as well as its trading role. This port was mainly sold
        and exchanged products such as gold, gems, silks, ivory, rice, fruits,
        elephants, buffalos and rhinoceroses. The port also served as a
        departure point for travel and transport to places along the Tonle Sap,
        Mekong an Bassac Furthermore, archaeological excavations show fragments
        of many different kinds of ceramics from Japan, China and Vietnam.
        Importantly, the port of Longvek and Oudong appear to have had a strong
        relationship. <br /><br />
        2. SUB-REGIONAL Bagan (Myanmar: 11-13th century C.E.):The city of Bagan
        was also erected close to the river. There were many religious building
        was installed in the entire area. However, those religious buildings are
        mainly stupas for Gotama Buddha, built as acts of merit making, serving
        as city landmarks and also to mark military victories. Where the stupas
        were installed, there were absent of the houses and settlement. This
        aspect is slightly different from Oudong city, as the city and the
        sacred site is adjacent to each other. Sokhothai (Thailand: 13th century
        C.E.) : Sokhothai was very big and also famous city built along the
        river with many beautiful and important Buddhist structures such as
        stupas. However, those stupas were built to worship the Buddha. The city
        was having also an important port. Ayutthaya (Thailand: 15th - 17th
        century C.E.): The site was constructed along the river where the city
        composed of the port. The site was constructed along the river where the
        city composed of the port. The port was also one of the important
        destinations to sell and buy the products. There are a great number of
        the Buddha stupas on the site. Overall Conclusion The ancient city of
        Oudong combined a complete infrastructure for both the people and the
        royal family, administrative systems, rice fields, workshops, markets
        and an important port. People were not only connected with other local
        communities, but they were a part of international communication and
        especially trading with the counties in Asia and Europe.
