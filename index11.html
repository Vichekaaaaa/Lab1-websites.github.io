      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Preah Khan Kompong Svay bears the original name of “Bakan” which refers
        to a high tower or citadel. It is a large Khmer temple complex located
        in Sangkum Thmei commune, Preah Vihear province, approximately 105km to
        the east of Angkor. The temple is well known for three things ; firstly
        it was a Mahayana-Buddhism temple related the concept of pure land,
        secondly it served as one of the way stations (the temples d’etape) at
        least since 12th century on the east-bound ancient highway network
        (Royal Road) starting from Angkor Thom, passing through Beng Mealea to
        Preah Khan Kompong Svay, and thirdly, it is a industrial centre relating
        to the region’s iron mining, smelting and production activities.
        <br /><br />
        It is clear that the main complex of the temple was built during the
        reign of three kings: Suryavarman I (1011-1050), Suryavarman II
        (1113-1150), and Javavarman VII (1181-1215). With regard to the general
        layout of temple, it is surrounded by four enclosure walls. The main
        sanctuay and outer enclosure are suggested to have been built by King
        Suryaravarman I; the second enclosure dated to the period of Suryavarman
        II. ; and the 3rd and the completion of the 4th enclosure, and baray are
        attributed to King Jayavarman VII. Three prominent hydraulic structures
        can be found within this complex: the moat of the 4th enclosure wall,
        the baray and the lake of Boeng Krom. The 4th enclosure is approximately
        5000 x 5000 metres and is a large triple banked /double moat structure.
        The baray of PreahPreah Khan Kompong Svay is approximately 600 x 3000
        metres with a mebon at the center called Prasat Preah Thkol. The
        characteristic art style in this temple is very unique. Each corner of
        the central tower was designed with three-tiers of decoration. The upper
        tier appeared with the image of the three-headed Hamsa, Garuda and
        three-head elephant (Airavata). The Lake of Boeng Krom (or Boeng Sre) is
        located at the north inside the compound between the 3rd and 4th
        enclosures. At the north bank of this lake, there are many scattered
        ceramic zones, and metallurgy sites have also been confirmed. The
        typical architectural art style of King Jayavarman VII is clearly found
        at Prasat Preah Stung located at the north west of the baray. The
        sanctuary contains dsitinctive four-faced towers. Moreover, on the east
        bank of the baray, there is another pyramid temple, named Prasat Preah
        Damrei, which at the top terrace were installed elephant statues in each
        corner, similar to that found at East Mebon temple in Angkor. Moreover,
        the evidence of Buddhism is found on the lintel of this complex, which
        is related to the concept of ‘pure land’ in Mahayana-Buddhism.
        Similarly, another Buddhist shrine has been found in this complex, named
        Prasat Chaktomuk. It has a 9.5m standing Buddhist images facing to the
        four cardinal directions.
      </p>
      <h3>Justification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle</h3>
      <p>
        The temple of Preah Khan Kompong Svay is a unique complex which can be
        seen from different perspectives such as the architectural layout
        conveying the concept of the ‘pure land’ of Buddhist philosophy, way
        station, iron industrial city and the uniqueness of its art motif
        decoration. Architectural layout interpreting the concept of ‘pure land’
        in Mahayana Buddhis. At Preah Khan Kompong Svay, the five Buddhas image
        were depicted in various places such as on the lintel, and other
        structural elements. In Mahayana Buddhism, the five Buddhas represent
        the cosmic Buddhas known as, Vairochana; Ratnasambhava; Amoghasiddhi,
        Amitabha, and Akshoya. They were employed in Tantric practice and linked
        to the five elements, and five energies of the body. Therefore, their
        presence in various places at Preah Khan Kompong Svay is a means of
        expressing the Buddhist cosmic diagram in architecture. Preah Khan
        Kompong Svay as a way station and iron industrial city. Preah Khan
        Kompong Svay served as an important way station city for the east-bound
        Angkor Royal Road network, as concluded from the character of the temple
        d’etape and remnants relating to the iron industry found in situ.
        Regarding the temple d’etape, along the east-bound ancient highway from
        Angkor Thom to Preah Khan Kompong Svay, there are 10 temples known as:
        Chou Say Tavoda, Thommanon, Banteay Samre, Chau Srei Vibol, Banteay
        Ampol, Beng Mealea, Toap Chey, Prasat Pram, Prasat Supheap Tbong, Prasat
        Chambok of Preah Khan Kompong Svay. These temples date to Angkor Wat
        style, during the reign of Suryavarman VII. Inside in the compound of
        Preah Khan Kompong, are to be found some 18 places that have remnants of
        concentrations of metallurgy activities, around Boeung Krom, and
        scattered in the area between the 3rd and 4th enclosures. Based on this
        evidence, some scholar proposed that Preah Khan Kompong Svay was one of
        the industrial cities that supplied the iron material for Angkor, whose
        prowess in warfare was believed to have largely dervived from mastery of
        producing iron weaponry. Art motifs decoration At Preah Khan Kompong
        Svay, there emerged a distinct character of arts motif which was not
        found before in Khmer art history. It shows as a dynamic and new
        creative art for the style of Jayavarman VII. Different from Angkor,
        most of the motifs were representations and interpretations of the
        creatures described in religious texts, for example Hamsa with three
        heads, three-headed elephants, and the Garuda. Especially, the selection
        the motif of designs were concerned with the hierarchy in religious
        context, especially the faith of Trimurti. Other remarkable images at
        Preah Khan Kompong Svay included a standing lion with a posture of
        moving forward, and at Prasat Damrei an elephant with the feet of a
        Garuda. The continuous use of the concept of Buddha of Chaktomuk for the
        city The statue of standing Buddha as a form of Chaktomuk, found at
        Preah Khan Kampong Svay is the only one remaining in Cambodia. Chaktomuk
        is considered as the symbol of god protecting the city. Such a faith has
        been strongly adapted in the Khmer urbanizing concept at least since the
        13th century onward. For example, Jayavarman VII renovated Angkor Thom
        city (13th century) by constructing the Bayon temple at the center point
        of the city. The city of Longvek existed Tro leng Keng (17th century),
        and Phnom Penh was located at the conjunction of four rivers called
        Chaktomuk. Khmer believe that the conjunction place or four cardinal
        direction represent the new creation, while in Hindu text the power of
        god (particularly in the form of Barhma) spreads out through each
        direction. Therefore, Chaktomuk at Preah Khan Kompong Svay has
        significance both in the value of the object itself, and also the
        indication it denotes that this was a flourishing city. <br /><br />
        Criterion (ii): Preah Khan Kompong Svay was a provincial city that
        functioned as a way station linked to the central area of Angkor. This
        complex, located along the ancient Royal Road, shows town planning that
        was well organised and had uniques design to facilite the production of
        iron, which was done directly inside the complex itself. Morever, the
        location of the town was close to the location rich in iron resources.
        In addition, the concept of the city was conveyed via characteristic
        religious monuments and features.
      </p>
      <h3>Déclarations d’authenticité et/ou d’intégrité</h3>
      <p>
        Archaeological remains found in situ, are physical evidence of a model
        of a satellite city in the Khmer empire. These can be seen clearly
        uniqueness of concept via the well-designed urban planning, especially
        the interaction between various types of remains, the ancient road, iron
        industryl remains, and religious elements. The cluster of industrial
        remain (iron kilns) inside the ancient complex conveys a long history of
        metallurgy in Cambodia. It believed that the high capacity in iron
        making at Preah Khan Kampong Svay made a big contribution in creating
        the Angkor civilization. Ethnographical research around this temple
        complex shows there still exists the Kuy ethnic group, who are skillful
        and have a long tradition in producing iron tools for Khmer kings. In
        addition, the immediate vicinity of Preah Khan Kompong Svay complex, is
        a mountain called Phnom Dek (Iron Mountain), that is indeed rich in iron
        ore. Viewed from a religious context, Preah Khan Kompong Svay also is
        notable as one of the Mahayana Buddhist cities dated fromto at least the
        13th century. The four-faced tower of Prasat Preah Stung, and the
        Chaktomuk Buddha in this site convey a message that this area symbolizes
        a flourishing city. These are characteristic symbols of the urbanized
        the Khmer city and lasted until the present day, as seen in the Royal
        Palace in Phnom Penh
