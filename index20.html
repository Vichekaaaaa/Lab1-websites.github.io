        Under the new name “Angkor Green Gardens”, the former Cambodian Cultural
        Village in Siem Reap has reopened, welcoming thousands of visitors for
        free until June 30. Hang Vannak, the general manager of Angkor Green
        Gardens, told The Post: “We opened to allow tourists to visit Angkor
        Green Gardens on the holiday for the birthday of Her Majesty the Queen
        Mother. We attracted many guests on Saturday June 18, recording 7,720
        visitors, with more than 13,018 on the Sunday. “Over the two days of
        June 18-19, we did see foreign visitors, according to observations
        between two to five per cent, mostly foreigners living in Cambodia.” He
        said on June 20 that Angkor Green Gardens continued to welcome a steady
        stream of visitors, although numbers naturally dropped slightly during
        the working and school week. The reopening has been carried out by the
        large Cambodian hotel investment company, Dara Hotels, which has been
        studying a master plan for the development of Angkor Green Gardens, as
        well as focusing on the maintenance and renovation of attractions.
        “Regarding the detailed plans, we are in the study phase, which requires
        an examination of the flow of visitors and the flow of the economy. “The
        clean-up and renovations started in May, with us cleaning up as much as
        possible and bringing the gardens back to life. This was the first
        mission. We are now looking to develop other areas to offer tourists
        more options and attract more visitors,” Vannak said. Located along
        National Road 6 in Kaksekam Village, the 21-hectare site consists of a
        wax museum and 12 villages based on Cambodian heritage. Tourists can
        enjoy free entry to Angkor Green Gardens until the end of the month,
        with tickets set to go sale in July, its general manager said. “After
        opening with free entry, we will from the beginning of July be selling
        tickets at very reasonable prices for both Cambodians and foreigners.
        “We want to promote our tourism to attract more visitors because Siem
        Reap was very badly affected by the two-year Covid crisis, and we want
        to move on to enable our people to again have jobs and enjoy increased
        economic momentum,” Vannak said. The Ministry of Tourism on June 20,
        2022 revealed that 364,636 tourists domestic tourists travelled the
        country – with Siem Reap welcoming a total of 48,867 visitors – on the
        weekend of June 18-19, 2022, an increase of 11 .45 per cent on last
        weekend. According to the ministry report, the number of visitors in
        Siem Reap increased significantly that weekend, especially with the
        opening of the Angkor Green Gardens, with the Apsara National Authority
        having launched the Angkor Botanical Garden on May 18. The Cambodian
        Cultural Village Company announced the complete closure of its business
        from November 7, 2020 after it could not afford to pay costs due to the
        sharp decline in the number of tourists as a result of the Covid-19
        pandemic.
