      <h3>Banteay Srei Temple</h3>
      <p>Constructed: Late 10th century C.E.</p>
      <p>Religion: Hindu (Shiva)</p>
      <p>King/Patron: Rajendravarman</p>
      <p>Style: Banteay Srey</p>
      <p>
        Consecrated in 967 A.D, Banteay Srei was speculated to have been known
        earlier as Banteay Serai, which literally means the Citadel of Victory.
        This was the only major temple at Angkor not built by a monarch; its
        construction is credited to a courtier named Yajnavaraha, who was a
        scholar and philanthropist and a counselor to king Rajendravarman. He
        was known to have helped those who suffered from illness, injustice or
        poverty. <br /><br />
        Banteay Srei is built primarily in red sandstone, a medium that lends
        itself to the elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still
        observable in fine details today. Measured by the standards of Angkorian
        construction, the buildings themselves are miniature in scale. These
        factors have led to its being widely praised as a ‘precious gem’, or the
        ‘jewel of Khmer art’ and perhaps the temple’s modern name, Banteay Srei
        or Citadel of Women, is probably related to the intricacy of the bas
        relief carvings of devatas found on the walls and the tiny dimensions of
        the buildings themselves.

        <strong>Banteay Srei or Banteay Srey</strong> (Khmer: ប្រាសាទបន្ទាយស្រី)
        is a 10th-century Cambodian temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.
        Located in the area of Angkor, it lies near the hill of Phnom Dei, 25 km
        (16 mi) north-east of the main group of temples that once belonged to
        the medieval capitals of Yasodharapura and Angkor Thom. Banteay Srei is
        built largely of red sandstone,a medium that lends itself to the
        elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still observable today. The
        buildings themselves are miniature in scale,unusually so when measured
        by the standards of Angkorian construction. The sefactors have made the
        temple extremely popular with tourists, and have led to its being widely
        praised as a "precious gem", or the "jewel of Khmer art." Consecrated on
        22 April 967 A.D., BantãySrĕi was the only major temple at Angkor not
        built by a monarch; its construction is credited to the courtiers named
        Vishnukumara and Yajnavaraha: 367 / Yajñavarāha (modern Khmer:
        យជ្ញវរាហៈ), who served as a counsellor to king Rajendravarman II (modern
        Khmer: ព្រះបាទរាជេន្រ្ទវរ្ម័ន). The foundational stela says that
        Yajnavaraha, grandson of king Harsavarman I, 117 was a scholar and
        philanthropist who helped those who suffered from illness, injustice, or
        poverty. His pupil was the future king Jayavarman V (r. 968- ca. 1001).
        Originally, the temple was surrounded by a town called Īśvarapura.
        Yajñavarāha's temple was primarily dedicated to the Hindu god Śiva.
        Originally, it carried the name Tribhuvanamaheśvara—great lord of the
        threefold world—in reference to the Shaivite linga that served as its
        central religious image. However, the temple buildings appear to be
        divided along the central east–west axis between those buildings located
        south of the axis, which are devoted to Śiva, and those north of the
        axis, which are devoted to Viṣṇu.
