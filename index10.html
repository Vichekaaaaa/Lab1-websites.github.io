      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        The Khmer Rouge regime governed Cambodia during Democratic Kampuchea
        (1975-1979) following a radical ideology - rooted from different
        communist beliefs and politics - that was put into practice in the
        entire country over an extremely short period of three years, eight
        months and twenty days. It is the only regime known to have emptied all
        cities in their sphere of power within days, forcing their inhabitants
        to move from their home places and to regroup in agricultural communes -
        as well as to undertake several subsequent massive population movements,
        involving also the rural. In a mixture of extreme nationalism and racism
        they wanted to realize an agrarian-autarkic society by destroying
        institutions of the former state, including schools, pagodas, industries
        and factories, killing intellectuals, professionals and monks,
        forbidding religion and traditions and replacing deep rooted family
        relations with the anonymous “Angkar” (the Organization). This so-called
        “Super great leap forward” was one of the most extreme examples of
        sociological experiment a regime or government ever tried to put in
        practice. It caused the death of millions inhabitants (around 25-30% of
        the entire population). The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and Choeung Ek
        Genocidal Center are the only historical sites that have so far been
        established as museum institutions in Cambodia to represent the crimes
        of the Khmer Rouge regime, although several smaller local memorials have
        been established, including the former prison M-13. <br /><br />
        The three crime sites (KR prison M-13/ KR “Security Office S-21”/ the
        Execution Site of S-21 “Choeung Ek”) are strongly linked to each other.
        In M-13 the later head of S-21, Kaing Guek Ieu, known as Duch, tested
        methods of interrogation and torture, before he later practiced and
        further developed them at S-21. After many prisoners were initially
        killed at S-21, the site Choeung Ek outside of the city was later chosen
        as a more appropriate site for mass execution. The vast majority of more
        than 18.000 prisoners of S-21 were killed at Choeung Ek. As it has been
        possible until today to safeguard all three sites, they can represent
        together an escalation of violence, which can help to understand, how
        happenings like at Choeung Ek were possible. All three sites should be
        seen together as a single sequence of serial memorial sites for
        remembering and historical learning. Together they can represent with
        high authenticity and integrity a chronological chain of extreme mass
        violence. M-13: Former early Khmer Rouge Prison and experimental site on
        detaining, torturing and killing including training of young prison
        guards by Duch. M-13 is one of the early prisons which the Khmer Rouge
        established before they gained control over the entire country in April
        1975. Although there were other such prisons around the country, this
        appears to be the only one that has been identified and converted into a
        site of remembrance and learning. Although M-13 moved three times in the
        area, this site in Prei Chrao Village, was its location for the longest
        period. Duch, the head of M-13, moved to Phnom Penh and was later
        appointed as head of S-21 (known today as TSGM), and it is unknown
        whether M-13 continued to be operational 1975-1979. The number of
        victims of M-13 is unknown too. However, in January 1979 it was
        abandoned by the retreating Khmer Rouge and since that date was not used
        anymore and left empty. While nature gradually covered over the most of
        the former above-ground traces during the past 40 years, no agriculture
        activities were undertaken here to destroy the underground traces.
        Furthermore, knowledge about M-13 is still vivid in the surrounding
        villages. Additional information: Name of institution: former M-13
        prison Location: Prei Chrao Village, Kbal Tek Commune, Tek Phos
        District, Kampong Chhnang province Size: about 1ha Historical period of
        interest: 1971 - 1975 Protected site since: 2019 Under control of:
        Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts (MoCFA) Public access: via Tuol Sleng
        Genocide Museum Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum: former “Security Office
        S-21” The core of S-21 prison was established in two adjacent former
        schools, built in the 1960s. Although the prison and its related
        administrative and support department were spread over a significant
        section of the city area (today known as BKK III), the TSGM site today
        occupies only the core of the former prison, the main site where the
        prisoners were brought, photographed, detained, many tortured,
        interrogated and executed or taken away to be killed at Choeung Ek.
        Current research estimates that 18.063 men, women and children were
        detained in S-21. Considering that many more houses in the neighborhood
        were part of the prison complex (work and accommodation places for the
        guards and other staff, kitchen, interrogation and torture houses,
        offices etc.), the museum took the initiative to seek limitation of
        nearby construction activities. Zones around TSGM have been defined and
        accorded legal status. (See master plan Phnom Penh 2019) Additional

        visitors per year Choeung Ek Genocidal Centre: the former Execution Site
        of S-21 Since 1950s and 60s, Choeung Ek compound was (in part) a Chinese
        cemetery before it was transformed into the execution site by Khmer
        Rouge as a part of S-21. Over a period of several years, nearly every
        night prisoners were taken there by trucks to be killed at Choeung Ek.
        In 1980, after Democratic Kampuchea was overthrown, the site was
        discovered and many remains of the victims were exhumed and examined,
        later to be preserved in a large Buddhist stupa. Thousands of Cambodian
        people and foreigners daily visit Choeung Ek to see the site and to
        organize religious ceremonies. It is the main site to celebrate the “Day
        of remembrance” each year on May 20. Additional information: Name of

      <h3>Justification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle</h3>
      <p>
        The Khmer Rouge regime governed Cambodia during Democratic Kampuchea
        (1975-1979) following a radical ideology - rooted from different
        communist beliefs and politics - that was put into practice in the
        entire country over an extremely short period of three years, eight
        months and twenty days. It is the only regime known to have emptied all
        cities in their sphere of power within days, forcing their inhabitants
        to move from their home places and to regroup in agricultural communes -
        as well as to undertake several subsequent massive population movements,
        involving also the rural. In a mixture of extreme nationalism and racism
        they wanted to realize an agrarian-autarkic society by destroying
        institutions of the former state, including schools, pagodas, industries
        and factories, killing intellectuals, professionals and monks,
        forbidding religion and traditions and replacing deep rooted family
        relations with the anonymous “Angkar” (the Organization). This so-called
        “Super great leap forward” was one of the most extreme examples of
        sociological experiment a regime or government ever tried to put in
        practice. It caused the death of millions inhabitants (around 25-30% of
        the entire population). The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and Choeung Ek
        Genocidal Center are the only historical sites that have so far been
        established as museum institutions in Cambodia to represent the crimes
        of the Khmer Rouge regime, although several smaller local memorials have
        been established, including the former prison M-13. Of particular
        significance as an extremely rare practice in the world, is this example
        of a society memorialising crimes committed by its “own” people. In
        addition to that, the three sites are three out of very few sites of
        remembrance of mass crimes in a Buddhist society, located in
        Southeast-Asia. As all three sites are still existing – former M-13,
        former S-21 and its former killing site at Choeung E, a serial sequence
        of sites presents a unique chance to explain how violence can escalate -
        a process that is represented by the sites, the buildings, the
        documents, bureaucratic structures, the practice of torture, the killing
        tools, etc. Specific Sites M-13, former early Khmer Rouge Prison
        (1971-1975): There are very rare cases, where a prison in the
        countryside (constructed only out of natural material without permanent
        buildings) has remained with visible traces after nearly 50 years. This
        site gives the unique chance to show that any prison (like the much
        better known S-21) has its pre-history, where guards were trained and
        the head of the prison invented and tested various methods of
        interrogation, torture and killing. Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, the
        former “Security Office S-21” (1976-1979): S-21 was one out of so far
        identified and documented 196 prisons throughout the country during the
        Khmer Rouge regime. The particular significance of S-21 and its
        distinction from the other prisons (some of them of the same size as
        S-21 and may have had even more victims) was that it was the apex of the
        nation-wide security system, and that prisoners were sent to S-21 from
        all around the country under the command of the Central Committee.
        Furthermore, these prisoners were destined to be killed. With very, very
        few exceptions nobody was to survive S-21, whose death rate was more
        than 99%. As the huge amount of documents produced in the S-21 prison
        institution (“confessions”, “biographies”, lists, notes, etc.)
        manifestly represent the ideology and hierarchical decision making
        process of the Khmer Rouge, the Tuol Sleng Archive’s more than 50.000
        documents from S-21 were successfully inscribed into the UNESCO “Memory
        of the World” International Register in 2009, following inscription on
        the Asia Pacific Regional Register in 2008. “Choeung Ek, the former
        Execution Site of S-21 (1976? -1978): Choeung Ek is one of thousands of
        killing sites throughout Cambodia. It was turned into a memorial site
        (including a small museum) and is the best known and is widely visited,
        as it was the killing site of S-21. The government (now since over 40
        years) has not buried or cremated the remains, which are visible in (a
        religious building) a stupa - although not in keeping with the religious
        beliefs and traditions of the Buddhist majority. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iii):</strong> The three sites are the principal
        sites in Cambodia, which have been turned into memorial site museums
        (institutions) to remember the crimes of the “Democratic Kampuchea”
        regime. As S-21 was unique – being the interrogation and torture site of
        the Central Committee – it is representing together with Choeung Ek a
        unique historical site in Cambodia. None of the so far identified 196
        prisons had this outstanding importance for the regime and also since
        its overthrow in 1979 as the principal locations to represent the crimes
        in total for the overall country. As Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and
        Choeung Ek are representing the crimes in total of the Khmer Rouge
        regime, it is at the same time the place to remember the attempt to kill
        entire minorities, like the Cham, the ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese
        inhabitants. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iv):</strong> The fact that all three sites still
        exist, are protected and managed by the government give the chance to
        present them together as an ensemble which illustrates a significant
        stage of inhuman history. The history of this ensemble marks the
        outstanding significance. It might not be outstanding, that school
        buildings are transformed into prisons or hidden spots in nature used as
        prisons and killing sites, but the the fact that the details of how Duch
        (head of prison M-13 and later S-21) developed his techniques of
        interrogation and torture, later accompanied by an extreme bureaucratic
        procedure, can be shown in the entire length of the history – pre-prison
        – central prison – killing site – in this series of three sites.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (vi):</strong> There have been mass crimes and
        attempts of genocide all over the world. But still not all crimes are
        the same. It is of universal significance to understand what was
        specific and outstanding in the crimes of the Khmer Rouge (see
        explanation above) and to acknowledge, that these three sites are the
        sites in Cambodia to remember the victims of the regime. The thousands
        of photos of prisoners together with the photos of mass graves and
        skulls have been endowed with an iconic status internationally to
        represent the image of the Khmer Rouge crimes. Without the institutions
        Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and Choeung Ek, the link to the real places,
        where these photos were taken, would not be possible. The buildings and
        landscapes (Choeung Ek and former M-13) provide the physical evidence
        that these crimes were committed. These sites have also held particular
        significance in the evolution of international criminal justice in the
        late 20th and early 21st centuries. The then just established museum
        Tuol Sleng played already the pivotal role in the world’s first trial
        against genocide, the People´s Revolutionary Tribunal in August 1979 and
        all three sites were examined intensively by the Extraordinary Chambers
        in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) established in 2006, the first hybrid
        court, initially termed “the Cambodian model”. In Case 002/2 the Trial
        Chamber found Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan guilty of crimes against
        humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and genocide of the
        Vietnamese ethnic, national and racial group. The Chamber additionally
        convicted Nuon Chea of genocide of the Cham ethnic and religious group
        under the doctrine of superior responsibility. Nuon Chea subsequently
        died. The conviction of Khieu Samphan is now (March 2020) under appeal
        to the Supreme Court Chamber. In addition to this juridical aspect of
        international importance, numerous researchers as well as artists have
        quoted, linked, recreated etc. images of Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and
        Choeung Ek and even M-13 in their works. The most famous is Rithy Panh,
        international recognized Cambodian filmmaker and author, who chose many
        topics related to S-21 and Duch as core of his artistic works over the
        last decades.
      </p>
      <h3>Déclarations d’authenticité et/ou d’intégrité</h3>
      <p>
        The three crime sites (KR prison M-13/ KR “Security Office S-21”/ the
        Execution Site of S-21 “Choeung Ek”) are strongly linked to each other.
        In M-13 the later head of S-21, Kaing Guek Ieu, known as Duch, tested
        methods of interrogation and torture, before he later practiced and
        further developed them at S-21. After many prisoners were initially
        killed at S-21, the site Choeung Ek outside of the city was later chosen
        as a more appropriate site for mass execution. The vast majority of more
        than 18.000 prisoners of S-21 were killed at Choeung Ek. As it has been
        possible until today to safeguard all three sites, they can represent
        together an escalation of violence, which can help to understand, how
        happenings like at Choeung Ek were possible. All three sites should be
        seen together as a single sequence of serial memorial sites for
        remembering and historical learning. Together they can represent with
        high authenticity and integrity a chronological chain of extreme mass
        violence. M-13, a former early Khmer Rouge Prison (1971-1975): M-13 is
        located in the countryside. During the prison time no buildings were
        constructed. The prisoners were kept in pits, fenced by bamboo walls and
        the guards including Duch slept and worked under the trees. The traces
        of the pits are clearly visible and nothing has been planted or
        constructed at this site since 1975. Although everything that was built
        out of natural material has decayed the soil still shows the traces;
        objects from the prison time were found; and interviews, testimony and
        even publications from former inmates and guards exist. Due to its
        untouched character, the site’s authenticity is considered to be high as
        corroborated in sworn testimony at the ECCC by surviving prisoners and
        guards well as in several written autobiographies Tuol Sleng Genocide
        Museum, the former “Security Office S-21” (1976-1979): The Museum today
        is the core of the former S-21 detention and torture center, located in
        five former school buildings. It is the only prison from the Khmer Rouge
        period to have been converted into a museum by the government and – very
        importantly -- this was done immediately after the fall of the Khmer
        Rouge in January 1979. That is why the vast majority of the rooms were
        kept in the same condition in which they were found in 1979. Only for
        the use of the permanent exhibition and office needs, rooms were partly
        changed. In most of the rooms the traces of the former cells are still
        visible on floors and walls and thousands of graffiti inscriptions have
        been registered and photographed. The premises (former high school)
        itself has not changed structurally (no buildings have been taken away
        or were added, only in the two courtyards, pathways have been added and
        trees planted, and memorials have been erected. The only new building is
        a small ticket office constructed in 2010 in a corner of the site. In
        addition to the site and the buildings an enormous amount of original
        documents and objects are preserved from the prison time, as documented
        in the nomination for Memory of the World registration. Furthermore, a
        wealth of documentation in the form of film and video recordings and
        journalistic rapportage and research findings, including several PhD
        theses, have been produced from the very first days of the prison’s
        location in January 1979 until today, as summarised in the Museum’s 40th
        anniversary exhibition and catalogue all substantiating the historical
        authenticity of the site and its role. As mentioned above, the original
        scope of the site during the Khmer Rouge regime was substantially
        larger, encompassing a whole section of the city. As the city was
        reoccupied following the overthrow of the regime, inhabitants moved into
        the residential houses and the area managed by the museum was
        progressively reduced. However, today’s Museum indubitably maintains the
        core of S-21’s detention and administrative facilities. Choeung Ek
        Genocidal Centre, the former Execution Site of S-21 (1976? -1978): The
        site (outside of the capital Phnom Penh, 15 km from S-21) had long been
        a Chinese cemetery before being used as the execution site of S-21,
        where it is estimated that the vast majority of the more than 18.000
        victims of S-21 were killed. When the site was discovered, a large
        number of bodies were exhumed, but other mass graves stayed untouched
        until today, some of which are now submerged under the nearby lake. At
        the end of the 1980s a stupa was erected beside the mass graves and the
        bones were stored (and remain on display in the stupa since). As more
        and more visitors came, pathways were constructed through the mass
        graves that until today still reveal traces of bones and textiles, but
        aside from this minimal intervention, the site has remained its former
        landscape. Besides the large stupa, a small museum, an entrance building
        and other facilities for tourists have been added. Photographic and
        written reports of exhumations in 1980 and later forensic examination of
        the remains provide extensive demonstration of the authenticity of this
        execution site, whose present extent substantially represents the whole.

        1. Other Memorial Sites (former camp and/or killing sites) remembering
        mass crimes already nominated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Poland:
        Auschwitz Birkenau (inscribed in 1979). Auschwitz Birkenau was the
        largest Concentration and Extermination Camp from the German Nazi period
        (from 1940-1945), where estimated 1.5 million people, among them a great
        number of Jews, were systematically starved, overworked and murdered. It
        has become the most recognized symbol of humanity´s cruelty in the 20th
        century. <br /><br />
        2. Other Memorial Sites, representing former Security prisons similar to
        S-21 or Killing Sites similar to Choeung Ek listed on a national UNESCO
        World Heritage Tentative List. Rwanda: Sites mémoriaux du genocide:
        Nyamata, Murambi, Bisesero et Gisozi (submitted 2012/ on tentative List
        Rwanda). These four sites outside of the capital Kigali represent some
        of the main sites of the genocide in 1994 against the Tutsis. To show
        that killings happened in several parts of the country, Rwanda decided
        to apply for a series of memorial sites, representing different
        buildings, stories and “left overs” from the victims. Rwanda: Sites

        3. Other Memorial Sites (former camp and/or killing sites) remembering
        mass crimes already nominated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Cambodia:
        Kraing Ta Chan, was - between 1973(!) and 1979 – the main security
        center in the district 105. It was located in the Southwest region, a
        region managed by Ta Mok, one of the cruelest Khmer Rouge leaders. The
        location was deep in the jungle, near the mountains, far from villages.
        It functioned in a similar way like M-13, later S-21 and Chouerng Ek.
        Suspected were imprisoned, interrogated, and killed. Kraing Ta Chan was
        one of a biggest killing fields in Cambodia where at least 10,045
        persons were killed. Besides S-21 it is the only (known) prison were
        documents about the prisoners were produced and later found. In
        difference to S-21 it only had a local function and most prisoners were
        brought from nearby communities.
