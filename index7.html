      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Beng Mealea is a very impressive temple built in the reign of King
        Suryavarman II, 12th century CE, and modified by Jayavarman VII. It is
        located in Beng Mealea village, Beng Mealea commune, Svay Leu District,
        Siem Reap province. It is about 77 Km Northwest of Siem Reap town and
        faces the eastern part of Kulen mountain on one side. Importantly, it is
        situated along the Royal Road to the east of Angkor, where leads from
        the eastern part of Bakheng mountain. From Angkor the Royal Road passes
        temples such as Bat Chum, Cao Srei Vibol, Banteay Ampil and Beng Mealea
        to Preah Khan Kampong Svay. This ancient road has well constructed
        bridges such as Spean Ta Oung, Spean Khvav and Spean Khmeng. Beng Mealea
        is flanked by Prasat Don Chan and Prasat Koh Chin on the west, Prasat
        Kong Pluk and Prasat Jrei on the east. <br /><br />
        Structure Beng Mealea was constructed on a large scale. Unfortunately,
        it is now seriously damaged due primarily to natural degradation and
        collapse. The main architectural element is sandstone which was taken
        from nearby quarries. The temple was built on a flat plan in a compound
        of 14 hectares, and consists of one central sanctuary, surrounded by
        three galleries and connected by cruciform galleries. It is surrounded
        by a moat of 1200m in length and 900m in width, a symbol of a cosmos
        ocean surrounding Mount Meru, the residence of all the Gods. There are
        four smaller strctures, previously termed "libraries"; two are in the
        inner enclosure and the other two are in the outer enclosure. The sites
        has three ponds located in the east and they are approximately on either
        side of the main entrance. Srah Keo and Srah Svaytong are in the north
        and Srah Thmar Baykream is in the south. Beng Mealea has two large
        structures on the south side of the third enclosure which have been
        termed “palaces” or halls for ritual ablutions and dances. This type of
        structure appears before the entrance of the sanctuaries, basins and
        other places. Generally, it has two levels, the upper level assumed to
        have been used for King and his family members and the lower level for
        the members of the court. It has a long causeway that leads from the
        east entrance to the moat, surrounded by Naga-balustrade and Lion
        statues. Significantly, there are three other causeways leading to the
        three other cardinal directions. These causeways are supported by
        cylindrical columns and also adorned with Naga-balustrades and Lion
        statues. A cruciform terrace leads to the Gopura of the outer galleries.
        Furthermore, two architecture innovations can be seen in this temple
        complex. They are wide vaulted roof galleries in stone and a vault
        supported on one side by a row of pillars and on the other side by a
        wall. Decoration Beng Mealea was decorated with 180 lintels, depicting
        the scenes of Churning the Sea of Milk, Mahabharata, Ramayana and some
        individual Brahmanic deities such as Siva, Brahma and Ganesha. It is
        unlikely that the walls did not bear decoration – either bas-reliefs or
        were probably coated with frescoes as there is no remaining trace of
        carved stone. The pediment depicted deity scenes, most of which were
        presented in multiple levels creating significant style and beauty.
        Cylindrical columns, divided into 7 sections, are fully decorated with
        florals and vines can also be seen, and door frames are decorated with
        flowers, vines and some tiny figures of deities. This type of decoration
        is also found at Angkor Wat of particular note are: the Dvārapāla (door
        guardians) figure, which look quite similar to at Banteay Samre temple,
        in their clothing and especially the fishtail design for the sampot;
        secondly, a figure of a divinity, who might be sitting on a cow (Siva)
        or buffalo (Yama), 61cm high; and thirdly, the torso of a male figure,
        61cm in height. A further 34 fragments of divinities were found in the
        year 2000, most of which are fragments of Dvārapāla, lions and columns.
        It is rare to find the statues of the deities in the temple. However,
        there are three statues originating from Beng Mealea presently housed in
        the Depot of Angkor Conservation. The statue of Avalokitesvara with four
        arms, 140cm in height was found in the first enclosure between the four
        central sanctuaries and library. According to the four tier design of
        the, this statue probably was made in the first half of the 12th century
        CE.
      </p>
      <h3>Justification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Criterion (ii):</strong> Beng Mealea was a central point on a
        crossroads between east-west and north-south routes, where products from
        the Kulen mountains and neighbourhoods along the Royal Road were
        exchanged, including sigbificantly, marine products from the Tonle Sap
        and even some foreign goods. It was also a check point for staging
        military and ceremonial processions and other state missions to the
        east. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iv):</strong> Beng Mealea is an Angkorian temple
        constructed on a flat plan, often described as two-dimensional version
        of Angkor Wat. The techniques of construction and decoration are
        recognised in a high standard and craftsmanship of Khmer art in
        particular. The design and decoration show a combination of three
        styles, Baphoun, Angkor Wat and early Bayon. Furthermore, it is an
        outstanding example of temple-town landscape divided into regular
        orthogonal city blocks by the road grid and pond arrangments. Every
        block furnished with number of elevated occupation mounds and ponds".
        Importantly, it is a hydraulic city, based on managing water flowing
        from Kulen mountain to the moat, baray and the ponds. A 200m width dyke
        near the temple was also used to supply water to the whole area aroujd
        it, and was believed to have been used as the route for transportating
        the stone from quarries near Beng Mealea to Angkor.
      </p>
      <h3>Déclarations d’authenticité et/ou d’intégrité</h3>
      <p>
        Beng Mealea is in a remote landscape setting, more authentically like
        the ancient landscape than many of the major temples of Angkor. After
        being virtually lost in the jungle for many years, no major conservation
        or restoration work has been done and most of its components are still
        intact and in situ, even if collapsed and some damaged. Beng Mealea is
        not part of Angkor Zone. However, this temple is under the management
        and protection from APSARA Authority (The Authority for the protection
        and management of Angkor and region of Siem Reap). APSARA Authority was
        doing some minor preventive conservation activities on the temple. Some
        international organizations are also taking part to do the researches
        and studies.
      </p>
      <h3>Comparaison avec d’autres biens similaires</h3>
      <p>
        The principal philosophies and religions in ancient Cambodia were
        undoubtedly rooted in India, and religious temples and images of the
        divinities show Indian inspiration. However, the style of architectural
        structures and decorations are distinctive, from India, Dvaravati, Mon
        or Champa either. Within the Kingdom, Khmer art rapidly developed
        showing distinct characteristics in the eras of individual Kings,
        especially certain “Great Kings”. In the 12th century, King Suryavarman
        II who was one of the great Kings in the history of Cambodia built many
        big and important temples. The most famous of course is Angkor Wat
        temple and others in that style include Dhammanon, Cao Srei Vibol as
        well as Beng Mealea. However, those temples have distinctive features,
        except for some decorations and motifs. Exceptionally, the function of
        Beng Mealea could be similar to some temples below. <br /><br />
        1. NATIONAL Preah Khan Kampong Svay (Cambodia: late 12th-13th century)
        Preah Khan Kampong Svay is a temple that was built and used by many
        Great Kings of the Khmer Kingdom, including Suryavarman I, Suryavarman
        II and Jayavarman VII. This temple is also located on the extreme end of
        Royal Road to the east of Angkor while Beng Mealea is approximately half
        way between Angkor and Preah Khan Kampong Svay. The architectural design
        of Beng Mealea Preah Khan Kampong Svay share many features but are by no
        means replicas. Furthermore, they each served political and economic
        functions of the Kingdom in their respective localities areas.
        <br /><br />
        2. SUB-REGIONAL Vat Phu (Laos: 10th-early 11th century C.E.) Vat Phu
        temple, is also located on the Royal Road heading to the northeast, in
        present day Laos. It is also a big Hindu temple, with outstanding
        architectural plan, design and decoration showing connections between
        nature and humanity. It also served the political and economic purposes
        for the Kingdom. Phimai (Thailand: 12th-13th century C.E.) Phimai temple
        was a very important temple in the reign of King Jayavarman VII,
        although the site had been used before him, f including in the reigns of
        King Jayavarman VI and Suryavarman II. This temple is also erected on
        the Royal Road from Angkor towards the west. The design and decoration
        of this temple are much more related to the religion and political
        administration in the reign of King Jayavarman VII and the Kings before
        him. Overall Conclusion: In terms of design, Beng Mealea temple is one
        of the most interesting temples among many reigns of Great Kings of
        Angkor, especially among the temples of King Suryavarman II in the 12th
        century. It was built on a plan showing significant complexity of
        architecture and art work, which is possible to compare only with the
        most highly regarded temple of Angkor Wat. Each element of the temple
        providedd effective functions for religious needs while also symbolizing
        the universe or the cosmos, the most meaningful element for the vision
        of the people in Southeast Asia. Such outstanding art connects humans to
        the Gods and illustrates the life and prosperity of the human. It
        expressed the harmony of the religion toward the people and was a means
        to transmit knowledge of the people from one area to another, crossing
        political boundaries.
