      <h3>Koh Ker</h3>
      <p>
        The archaeological site of Koh Ker is a sacred urban ensemble of
        numerous temples and sanctuaries including sculptures, inscriptions,
        wall paintings, and archaeological remains. Constructed over a
        twenty-three-year period, it was one of two rival Khmer Empire capitals
        – the other being Angkor – and was the sole capital from 928 to 944 CE.
        Established by King Jayavarman IV, his sacred city was believed to be
        laid out on the basis of ancient Indian religious concepts of the
        universe. The new city demonstrated unconventional city planning,
        artistic expression and construction technology, especially the use of
        very large monolithic stone blocks.

      <h3>Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis</h3>
      <p>
        Koh Ker: Archaeological Site of Ancient Lingapura or Chok Gargyar was a
        capital of the Khmer Empire between 921 and 944 CE. Partially hidden in
        a dense broad-leaf forest between the Dangrek and Kulen mountain ranges
        on a gently sloping hill some eighty kilometres northeast of Angkor, the
        archaeological site comprises numerous temples and sanctuaries with
        associated sculptures, inscriptions, and wall paintings, archaeological
        remains and hydraulic structures. <br /><br />
        Established by King Jayavarman IV in 921 CE, Koh Ker was one of two
        rival capitals of the Khmer Empire that co-existed between 921 and 928
        CE – the other being Angkor – and the sole capital until 944 CE, after
        which the Empire’s political centre moved back to Angkor. Constructed in
        a single phase over a twenty-three-year period, the sacred city was
        believed to be laid out on the basis of ancient Indian concepts of the
        universe. Koh Ker demonstrated markedly unconventional city planning and
        architectural features, which were primarily the result of the
        combination of King Jayavarman IV’s grand political ambition and the two
        outstanding innovations that helped to materialise this ambition: the
        artistic expressions of the Koh Ker Style, and the construction
        technology using very large monolithic stone blocks. Although
        short-lived as a capital and thus acting only as an interlude in Khmer
        history, these innovations had a profound and lasting influence on urban
        construction and artistic expression in the region. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (ii):</strong> The archaeological site of Koh Ker
        exhibits in an exceptional way the interchange of human values that
        resulted in the Koh Ker Style, a sculptural expression featuring bold,
        expressive imagery and a dynamic sense of movement that resulted from
        the fusion of Indian religious and artistic symbolism with local design
        concepts and artistic craftsmanship. The Koh Ker Style, though formed
        within a short period of twenty-three years in the 10th century, had an
        enduring influence on the artistic expression of the subsequent period
        of the Khmer Empire and other Southeast Asian countries. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iv):</strong> The archaeological site of Koh Ker is a
        prototype of a new urban landscape featured by grand-scale buildings,
        thanks to the use of colossal monolithic stone blocks for construction
        and sculptures. It had inaugurated a centuries-long phase of stone
        temple construction across the Khmer Empire and became a source of
        inspiration for the great monuments of Angkor and Southeast Asia in
        later centuries.

      <h4>Integrity</h4>
      <p>
        All attributes necessary to express the Outstanding Universal Value of
        the property, including the temples and sanctuaries, archaeological
        remains and hydraulic structures, are included within the property. The
        layout and built environment of the entire ancient capital are evident.
        Many looted sculptures have been repatriated. Threats to the attributes
        are under control.
      </p>
      <h4>Authenticity</h4>
      <p>
        The link between the property's attributes and its Outstanding Universal
        Value is truthfully expressed, and the archaeological remains can be
        said to truthfully convey their meaning; there are no conjectural
        reconstructions. The absence of later modifications or reuse after its
        abandonment in the 15th century has left the property with a high level
        of authenticity in terms of its location and setting, forms and designs,
        and materials and substances, as demonstrated by the archaeological
        evidence. The geographical location of the ancient capital city, the
        layout of the original urban plan, and the archaeological remains of the
        temples, royal palace, hydraulic systems, sculptures, inscriptions, and
        wall painting are authentically preserved in situ. The property is the
        same size and is in almost the same condition as at the time of its
        documentation in the late 19th century.
      </p>
      <h4>Protection and management requirements</h4>
      <p>
        Koh Ker: Archaeological Site of Ancient Lingapura or Chok Gargyar is
        protected by the Law on the Protection of Cultural Heritage (1996). The
        Royal Decree on the Establishment of Koh Ker Temple Site,
        NS/RKT/0504/070, of 2004, as amended in 2020, defines the boundaries of
        the property, the buffer zone, and the satellite zone beyond the buffer
        zone. <br /><br />
        The National Authority for Preah Vihear (NAPV) is the dedicated
        governmental authority that oversees policy formulation and
        implementation for the protection and conservation of the property, and
        for combating illegal destruction, alteration, excavation, alienation or
        exportation of cultural objects at both Preah Vihear and Koh Ker. The
        NAPV technical teams, together with the active participation of the
        community, undertake activities for the conservation and promotion of
        the property according to a Comprehensive Cultural Management Plan. The
        International Coordinating Committee for Preah Vihear advises and
        monitors all NAPV activities. Heritage Impact Assessment mechanisms have
        been embedded in the current management system. Risk management for both
        the natural environment and the cultural heritage is carried out by
        staff with adequate equipment following established procedures. Specific
        long-term expectations include building up staff capacity.
