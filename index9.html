      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Phnom Kulen range is located 30 km northeast of Angkor archaeological
        site, Siem Reap province, northwest Cambodia. It is registered since
        1992 on the Government of Cambodia’s tentative list as a World Heritage
        potential cultural site, with the criteria V and VI. Phnom Kulen means
        the Mountain of Leeches in Khmer. According to the old Khmer
        inscriptions (and particularly Sdok Kak Thom inscription), the mountain
        is known as Mahendraparvata, the mountain of the Great Indra, an ancient
        city established at the late 8th-early 9th-centuries, comprising several
        temples, the religious remains of this former capital of the Khmer
        Empire. The capital was settled on the plateau, located 70 Km to the
        south of the Dangrek Mountains, and 30 Km away from the great Tonle Sap
        Lake. Today, the Phnom Kulen national Park is a 37,375-hectares
        protected area, located in Banteay Srey, Svay Leu and Varin districts,
        in Siem Reap province. <br /><br />
        The ancient Mahendraparvata (late 8th-early 9th centuries) on Phnom
        Kulen is today a partially forested site containing about 40 brick
        temples, including one pyramid mountain-temple, as well as ancient
        reservoirs, dykes with spillway, channels, ponds, plots, platforms, and
        earthen mounds, all part of an ancient urban system. Other later
        archaeological remains are also located on Phnom Kulen such as dozen
        prehistoric sites with rock paintings, more than 40 rock shelters
        occupied by hermits from the 10th century, including 2 sculpted riverbed
        (Kbal Spean and the One Thousand Linga), ceramic kilns dated from the
        10th to 11th centuries, a late Angkorian temples such as Prasat Krol
        Romeas located at the large natural waterfall (end of the 12th century),
        and the large and very much venerated nowadays Preah Ang Thom reclining
        Buddha. Phnom Kulen is located in Northwest Cambodia, such as the others
        Cambodian Cultural World Heritage sites: Angkor, Preah Vihear and Sambor
        Prei Kuk. The mountain range is also at the origin of the Siem Reap
        River, as well as the other main rivers of Angkor region (Puok and
        Roluos). It has a major role for the local aquifer and for the surface
        water, draining most of the plateau before reaching Angkor, nourishing
        its entire hydraulic system, the major reservoir (baray) and the temples
        or city moats through a network of channels, and ending in the great
        Tonle Sap Lake. In addition, Phnom Kulen holds a major symbolic
        significance for the ancient Khmer Empire as, according to ancient
        inscription, King Jayavarman II proclaimed independence from Java in 802
        CE from the city of Mahendraparvata. There also, this king initiated the
        first Devaraja cult of the king, as stated in Sdok Kak Thom inscription
        (Michael and Evans, 2018: 118). Among local recent legends, one
        identifies the mountain with the place where Buddha stepped a foot, when
        the entire country was flooded. Recently, the LiDAR technology has
        revealed a very large and formally planned network of oriented earthen
        dikes forming axis. This urban grid connects previously known, temples,
        and the water infrastructures, such as the dams blocking the valleys of
        the plateau and creating large reservoirs. Organizing the landscape on a
        large scale (more than 40 km2), it also organizes settlement plots. Most
        of the temples are single brick towers, attributed to Jayavarman II
        reign. One of them stands out, Prasat Rong Chen, the five-tiered pyramid
        temple built on the highest point of the southern part of the plateau.
        Partially constructed from leveling or soils embankments (first two
        levels) and laterite blocks (last three levels), the temple’s top level
        is accessible by ramps, unique remains of a construction left
        unfinished. An unfinished large reservoir, or baray, was also evidenced
        thanks to the Lidar technology. Additionally, the Royal Palace of the
        ancient capital (Banteay) was identified in 2009 (Chevance, 2014) and
        confirms the presence of the king and his court on the plateau, at the
        early 9th century. Mahendraparvata (Phnom Kulen) is, therefore, very
        significant as it is one of the earliest capitals of the Angkor period,
        which extended from the 9th to 15th centuries. Systematic archaeological
        survey and excavations have identified an array of cultural features.
        There are more extensive of a large settlement than the historical
        record indication. For instance, later Angkorian inscriptions often
        refer to Jayavarman’s capital on the plateau, but no inscriptions dating
        from that period have been found so far in Phnom Kulen. However, the
        significant infrastructures in Phnom Kulen demonstrated the “first
        engineered landscapes of the era, offering key insights into the
        transition from the pre-Angkorian to Angkorian period, including
        innovations in urban planning, hydraulic engineering and sociopolitical
        organization that would shape the course of the region’s history for the
        next 500 years” (Chevance et al, 2019: 1305). Mahendraparvata on Phnom
        Kulen, “therefore, represents a significant milestone in the development
        of urban from/in the region” (Chevance et al, 2019: 1317). It is
        believed that “the grid of major axes provides the overall framework
        upon which other patterns of habitation are based and elaborated”
        (Chevance et al, 2019:1316). According to Lidar and following field
        verification researchers “found hundreds of ponds within the central
        area, only two of them interrupt the course of the major axes, the other
        ponds are scattered within the city blocks” (Chevance et al, ibid).
        Several evidences “suggest that the central grid was laid out before, or
        during, the elaboration of the habitation network, and that the two
        systems functioned contemporaneously” (Chevance et al, ibid). The
        existence of a royal palace, numerous temples and neighbourhoods,
        indicate that a royal court was located on the Kulen plateau. A
        substantial population living in “an extensive, well-defined, built-up
        area” supports it (Chevance et al, 2019:1318). “This area was clearly of
        parceled neighbourhoods indicate that it was not merely a vacant
        ceremonial centre (Chevance et al, 2019:1318). Prior to the
        Mahendraparvata construction, “the evidence shows that settlement
        patterns in the Angkor region comprised small, loosely structured urban
        areas that lacked any formal grid, had no clear boundaries and appear to
        have developed organically without a coherent plan. Beyond the Angkor
        region, a handful of centres show evidence of enclosing walls, for
        instead, at the sixth to eight centuries AD site of Sambor Prei Kuk. On
        the other hand, these much smaller in scale than at Mahendraparvata and
        contain no internal grids. Thus, Mahendraparvata marks an important
        point of departure, and appears to represent the first large-scale ‘grid
        city’ elaborated in the Khmer world. It would be some time before such a
        design would be fully realized again in the Angkor region. The
        ninth-century AD city of Hariharalaya, the capital immediately following
        Mahendraparvata, contains a monumental core but, overall, evinces an
        organic layout typical of the early Angkorian ‘open cities’ (Evans 2010;
        Pottier 2012). It is only in the tenth and eleventh centuries AD that
        the massive linear axes and internal frameworks of cities appear again
        in the Angkor region (Gaucher 2017), and not until the twelfth century
        that we have unambiguous evidence for gridded cities achieved on the
        same scale as Mahendraparvata (Evans 2016). Hence, the urban network
        revealed by lidar and described here seems to form an enormous and
        remarkably early experiment in formal urban planning. The urban model
        that first developed on this mountain plateau, although sparsely
        inhabited at the time and not widely adopted straight away, would
        eventually be adapted to the low-lying floodplains of Angkor, and become
        a prototype for high-density urban centres at the height of the Khmer
        Empire” (Chevance et al, 2019: 1317, 1318). Mahendraparvata map bring
        new insights regarding the history of the Angkorian urbanism. It
        combines the two previously identified forms (Evans et al, 2013; Evans,
        2016), while missing many other elements. It has an extended city grid,
        but without any attempt to define a central area with a wall or moat;
        the central grid does not appear to have been densely inhabited; and
        there is little evidence for intensive agricultural activity or a
        broader network of low-density occupation revolving around fields and
        ponds. Hence, while Mahendraparvata is immediately recognizable as
        Angkorian, and identifiably ‘urban’, it is totally unique in the Khmer
        world in its development of urban form (Chevance et al, 2019:1319).
        Moreover, the architecture and art of Phnom Kulen, moreover, indicate
        the development of a unique style during the reign of Jayavarman II, at
        the end of the 8th century. The sandstones decorative architectural
        elements (columns and lintels) and the sculptures progressed to a unique
        and a new “Kulen style”. This style illustrates a transition from the
        previous pre-angkorian styles to the future angkorian and post-angkorian
        styles. After this early capital of the Khmer Empire was abandoned as
        the siege of power, the court moved from Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen
        to (Hariharalaya in Rolous, 15 Km east of the future Angkor). Phnom
        Kulen site continued to be considered as a sacred mountain and later
        archaeological sites show, it was never completely abandoned. Epigraphic
        evidence indicated that Kings consecrated sculpture riverbed (Kbal
        Spean) and later temples and particular infrastructures such as
        channels, stairways, ceramic kilns or mounds fields evidence an
        occupation of the Phnom Kulen during the angkorian period. Nowadays,
        several Phnom Kulen archaeological sites still hold a sacred value for
        Cambodians and are the witnesses of an important worship by Khmer
        people, coming from the entire country. Monks and modern hermits often
        reused hermit’s sites, insuring a sacred continuity, and numerous
        legends, folktales, and narratives continue to be associated by the
        local communities to the archaeological sites. Finally, Phnom Kulen is
        also known to host the ancient quarries, where the sandstone blocks were
        extracted. From Phnom Kulen site, a complex and long network of channels
        and parallel raised earthen road allowed their transportation to Angkor,
        to build the prestigious religious monument, from the 10th century.
        Phnom Kulen ancient quarrying industry, known from the late 19th
        century, was developed on a very large scale, recently revealed by the
        Lidar (Evans, 2017). It has left numerous localized pits with high
        stepped surfaces forming a complex network of stone exploitation.

      <h3>Justification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle</h3>
      <p>
        The Phnom Kulen will be presented as an extension of Angkor site, in
        accordance with the guideline for the implementation of the 1972
        convention. The proposed tentative list meets criteria ii, iv, and v for
        the inclusion of Mahendraparvata on the World Heritage List, as a
        cultural site. There are three main outstanding universal value of
        Mahendraparvata/Phnom Kulen tentative list, as a first unique urban
        city, a living cultural heritage, and as the sandstone source for the
        construction of the Angkor temples (quarries location). Mahendraparvata
        on Phnom Kulen has recently discovered an immense, formally planned
        urban network, comprising axis and linking, temples, and water
        infrastructure (Chevance et al, 2019). The majority of temples from site
        are primarily built of brick, laterite, and also dates from the
        Jayavarman II period (Michael and Evans, 2018: 121). Together with the
        recently identified Royal Palace Banteay (Chevance, 2014), they
        confirmed the presence of this early Angkorian capital. Recently, the
        LiDAR mission identified an additional main piece of hydrological
        infrastructure in this area. The East-West orientated Thnal Srae Thbong
        dike and the 1 Km long Thnal Mrech dike (Pepper Dyke), with several 10th
        to 11th centuries ceramic kiln sites, are part of a very large
        unfinished reservoir of baray. This last feature completes, together
        with the mountain-temple and the Royal Palace, the main markers of an
        angkorian capital. They are integrated in the urban network and the
        whole indicates a significant evidence for the early Angkorian period to
        setup infrastructure and city. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criteriion (ii):</strong> Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen is a
        unique example of town-planning for an ancient city, with related
        infrastructure, temples, monumental artistic remains, and other
        archaeological sites. Mahendraparvata presents “a centrally planned
        urban area, spanning ∼40-50 Km2” of the plateau. This comprises a
        network of major thoroughfares that divide a central zone into a city
        grid; a system of smaller-scale land parceling that subdivides city
        blocks within that grid; a distribution of small shrines, mounds and
        ponds; a large-scale water-management system, consisting of dams and a
        major, unfinished reservoir; and finally, a distinctive spatial
        arrangement of a royal palace, state pyramid temple and other
        infrastructural elements that are consistent with and unique to all
        other known Khmer Empire capitals” (Chevance et al, 2019:1318).
        <br /><br />
        The complex demonstrates a significant interchange of human values
        during the early Khmer Empire, in 9th century. The site also indicated a
        masterpiece of human creative genius in terms of architectural
        framework, iconography, and an early and unique city planning from the
        Angkor period. The iconic architecture at Mahendraparvata on Kulen is
        seen in O Paong, Neak Ta, Thma Dap or Damrei Krap temples, and Rong Chen
        is the first pyramid temple in the angkorian world, built on a natural
        mountain. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iv):</strong> Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen is an
        outstanding example of a type of a unique, religious architecture,
        combined with a modified landscape to form one of the first grid city in
        ancient Cambodia. The religious monuments (about 40 brick temples) have
        been discovered on the plateau itself, in addition rock shelters, carved
        riverbed, and prehistoric site with rock painting. <br /><br />
        Furthermore, Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen presents various elements
        characteristic of an urban form from an Angkorian capital. The important
        Rong Chen mountain temple, with its distinctive pyramidal shape, is
        typical of other state temples located at the heart of pre-Angkorian and
        Angkorian urban areas. The Royal Palace with it “rectangular shape,
        size, orientation and architectural remains indicate that it was the
        center of power of a royal capital” (Chevance et al, 2019:1307), during
        the reign of Jayavarman II in AD 770-835. The royal capital presents a
        grid of major axes, which provides the overall framework upon in other
        patterns of habitation are based and elaborated. Therefore, “the network
        of Phnom Kulen mostly developed according to an overall plan, and the
        major axes, including the largest earthen dams, were the earliest and
        most fundamental elements of that design” (Chevance et al, 2019: 1316).
        Another famous site, Preah Ang Thom is an eight meters long statue of
        the reclining Buddha, estimated to be carved between the late angkorian
        period and the post-angkorian period (12th to 16th centuries). Preah Ang
        Thom is the most sacred and worshiped site for the Kulen Mountain after
        the angkorian period. Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen continued to be a
        significant worship settlement during the angkorian period, notably with
        the hermits in the rock shelters of Phnom Kulen. Therefore, Phnom Kulen
        has a significant cultural, which is necessary to preserve as an ancient
        city site and a cultural landscape. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (v):</strong> Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen presents
        a very large-scale and unique settlement from the 8th-9th centuries.
        Archaeological survey found hundreds of ponds within the central area
        and recovered some run along the ancient axis and dykes. Major dams were
        raised to block valleys and create reservoirs. The data also suggest
        that settlement on Mahendraparvata was not only spatially extensive but
        also temporally enduring. For example, Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen
        plateau comprised 366 individual mounds attributed to the 10th century.
        Moreover, sandstone quarries on the southeast foothill of Phnom Kulen
        indicate a very large industry, illustrating another human interaction
        with its natural environment from the 9th to 12th centuries. The
        quarries provided most of the sandstone blocks used to build the Angkor
        temples and most of the statues to represent the Khmer gods.
      </p>
      <h3>Déclarations d’authenticité et/ou d’intégrité</h3>
      <p>
        Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen is a proposed site, already projected as
        a National Park by the Cambodia Government, under a royal decree as
        Preah Jayavarman-Norodom Phnom Kulen National Park. It was established
        in 1993 and covers 373.73 km2. The systematic archaeological surveys and
        excavations have identified an array of cultural features. These sites
        are representative of the integrity for all attributes such as
        ‘historical, monumental, archaeological feature, natural landscape, and
        artifacts of the ancient complex; infrastructure of city planning,
        hydraulic feature, road network, water system, ritual and spiritual
        expression’, which characterized the nomination for a World Heritage
        Site. These significant elements contribute to the potential Outstanding
        Universal Value of the Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen represented by
        more than 40 brick temples, an urban network, water-management,
        infrastructures, and composing the structure of an ancient city. In
        addition, rock shelters, riverbed sculptures, and prehistoric rock
        painting sites, enhance the value of the site. The boundary of Phnom
        Kulen National Park includes the Phnom Kulen plateau and its
        environment, such as the protection forested area. Recently, remote
        sensing data have revolutionized our view, revealing the remains of a
        city with a complex and important extensive network of urban
        infrastructure. Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen has suffered damages from
        the ravage of time, looting during the Cambodian war (1970s-1990s),
        climate change, and historical events. Following the collapse of the
        Khmer Empire in the 15th century and civil war, Phnom Kulen was largely
        forgotten, except for its large reclining Buddha, which was a pilgrim
        center. It was not until the early 20th century that French explorers
        became aware of Jayavarman II city. The 1930’s exploration of Phnom
        Kulen confirmed its importance as a capital, revealing numerous brick
        temples with a homogenous architectural decoration. Some artifacts were
        sent to France for exhibition. Research stopped as Cambodia plunged into
        a civil war in the early 1970’s. Phnom Kulen would become a Khmer Rouge
        stronghold, preventing any archeological work for more than 25 years.
        The area became isolated and was vulnerable to looting. Some statues
        were relocated to Phnom Penh or Angkor Conservation for safety, while
        other were looted and went to private hands. After civil war’s end in
        the 1990’s, when peace arrived in Cambodia, Phnom Kulen was still
        isolated. Researches resume with a few institutions such as University
        of Sophia and Singapore, sponsoring excavation on the ceramic kiln
        sites. Since 2008, the APSARA Authority (in charge of Angkor Site
        management), and the Archaeology and Development Foundation (ADF) have
        started a collaborative project to explore the area, update the
        archaeological map of the mountain, excavate the most representative
        sites, restore the excavated artifacts and present a chronological
        occupation of the entire site. After LiDAR technology produced a new map
        of the region in 2012, the results showed that the property retains many
        features and monuments of which illustrated the exceptional cultural,
        architectural, artistic, historical, technological and hydraulic values
        of the site. Many temples and structures have been preserved.
        Restoration, and conservation have been applied to several ancient brick
        temples and structure. Recently, APSARA Authority continues the
        restoration and conservation of brick temples and sculptures. The
        decorative elements, statuary and inscriptions from this site have been
        preserved, researched, and documented. Many of the masterpieces have
        been restored, preserved, and exhibited in museums in Cambodia and
        oversea. Phnom Kulen LiDAR remote sensing technology allowed the
        scanning map of the region by using methods detailed by Evans (Evans et
        al, 2013). This revolutionary technique uncovered the extent of the
        Khmer Empire. Since then, ADF and APSARA field survey on Phnom Kulen has
        confirmed the discovery of a framework of linear axes, oriented roughly
        to cardinal directions and spanning much of the southern area of the
        plateau (Chevance et al, 2019). Surveys and excavations also indicated
        that many sites structures are in good condition. The Cambodian
        government secure the protection, with APSARA Authority actions, and 50
        workers and 3 archaeologists insure the regular cleaning and guarding of
        the major sites. Recently, restoration efforts have contributed to the
        preservation of several temples.

        The Mahendraparvata site on Phnom Kulen can be compared to four of ten
        different of World Cultural Heritage sites: on a national, sub-regional,
        regional and international level. This is not only complying with other
        World Heritage criteria, but also reflecting the period, features and
        characteristics, such as the influence of town-planning, urban
        infrastructure, language, religion, architecture, materials and
        hydrology. <br /><br />
        1. National Bakong temple (Cambodia: the 9th century C.E.): Bakong
        temple is the first temple mountain covered with sandstone, constructed
        by rulers of the Khmer empire at Hariharlaya, the capital right after
        Mahendraparvata, where the Jayavarman II declared the sovereignty of
        Cambodia. His successor, Indravarman I constructed the Bakong temple
        dedicated to the god Shiva and consecrated its central religious image,
        a linga whose name Sri Indresvara. The Devarāja cult, similar to
        Mahendraparvata’s on Phnom Kulen, consisted in the idea of divine
        kingship of royal power. The structure of Bakong has a stepped pyramid
        shape, similar to Rong Chen in Mahendraparvata, both identified as early
        example of Khmer temple mountain. In addition, the Bakong pyramid temple
        has been covered with high bas-relief, representing asuras in battle.
        Large stone statues of elephants are positioned as guardians at the
        corners of the three lower levels of the pyramid and statues of lions
        guard the stairways. Phnom Bakheng Temple (Cambodia: late 9th to 10th
        centuries): Phnom Bakheng temple is a mountain temple located in Angkor.
        Phnom Bakheng is one of three hilltop temples in the Angkor region that
        are attributed to Yasovarman’s reign (889-910 C.E). The other two are
        Phnom Krom to the south near the Tonle Sap lake, and Phnom Bok,
        northeast of the Eastern baray reservoir. Phnom Bakheng is a symbolic
        representation of Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods. This is a similar
        configuration with Rong Chen temple in Mahendraparvata/Phnom Kulen and
        Bakong temple at Hariharalaya Rolous. However, The Bakeng temple is
        built in a pyramid form of seven levels, representing the seven heavens.
        There are five sandstone sanctuaries on the top level. Originally, 108
        small towers were arrayed around the temple at ground level and its
        tiers. Bakeng temple built on a rectangular base and rise in five levels
        and is crowned by five main towers. One hundred and eight are considered
        the level of the god and haven. These 33 can be seen from the center of
        any side, but thirty-three is the number of gods who dwelt on Mount
        Meru. The center one represents the axis of the world and the 108
        smaller ones represent the four lunar phases, each with 27 days. The
        seven levels of the monument represent the seven heavens and each
        terrace contains 12 towers, which represent the 12 years cycle of
        Jupiter. Thus, it is an astronomical calendar in stone. Baksei Chamkrong
        (10th century): Baksei Chamkrong is a small Hindu temple located in
        Angkor. It is dedicated to lord Shiva and used to hold a golden image of
        him. It was also dedicated to Yasovarman by his son, King Harshavarman
        I. This temple is constructed by bricks and laterite with architectural
        decoration in sandstone. There is an inscription on either side of the
        doorway, which details the dedication and praises the early Khmer kings,
        quoting Jayavarman II who settled in Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen. The
        main sandstone lintel is decorated with a fine carving of Indra standing
        on his three-headed elephant Airavata. The brick sanctuary tower and
        eight meters square on a sandstone base open to the east. <br /><br />
        2. Sub-regional Borobudur temple (Indonesia: 9th century C.E.):
        Borobudur pyramid temple was constructed by the Sailendra dynasty in the
        9th century, in Central Java. It is dedicated as a Mahayana Buddhist
        temple, consisting of nine stacked platforms, six square and three
        circulars, topped by a central dome. The temple demonstrates the
        influences of Gupta art and reflects India’s influence on the region,
        but there are more elements to make Borobudur unique. Borobudur
        indicates a similarity with Bakong at Rolous and Rong Chen on
        Mahendraparvata/Phnom Kulen during 9th century C.E. The structure of
        Rong Chen and Bakong took shape of stepped pyramid, popularly identified
        as temple mountain of early Khmer temple architecture, but Borobudur
        worshiped on Buddhism. The striking similarity of both temple sites
        demonstrate similar into architectural details such as the gateways,
        sculpture decoration, stairs to the upper terraces. My Son (Vietnam: 4th
        to 14th centuries C.E.) and Hoa Lai: My Son site was constructed between
        the 4th and the 14th centuries by the Kings of Champa. The temples were
        built by brick and sandstone materials, and were dedicated to Hinduism,
        to worship the god Shiva. My Son site records and uses of sanskrit as
        well as architectural formulas demonstrate some similarity between some
        of Phnom Kulen temples (Damreï Krap, Khting Slap). Hoa Lai cham temple
        illustrates some similarity with Damrei Krap with its architecture and
        brick decoration. On a regional scale, iconography and decoration
        motives have been shared in all South-East Asia and similarities can be
        found in other historical complexes in Southeast Asia, such as Borobudur
        in Java, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and Bagan in Myanmar <br /><br />
        3. Regional Sahasralinga or Shalmala river (India: 17th century C.E.):
        The River Shalmala is located in the town of Sirsi, which is known for
        its Shiva linga carved on the rocks, along the banks and in the riverbed
        of the Shalmala River, in the Karnataka state, India. This decorated
        river with Linga is similar to the one found in Cambodia, and
        represented by only two sites, both located in Phnom Kulen National
        Park. One is Kbal Spean, located on the western range, the other on the
        Phnom Kulen plateau, the One thousand Linga. During angkorian period,
        the river was identified with Ganga, the sacred river of India, and by
        association, Phnom Kulen itself must have been associated with the
        mythic Himalayan mountains of Meru and Kailasa in India. Thus, both
        sites were a very holy place and it remains an important site of worship
        and pilgrimage until recently. This comparison emphasizes significant
        features with India of which are similar the form, believe, and
        sculptures. However, they do not have water management function rather a
        symbolic one. The Khajuraho (India:950 to 1050 C.E.): The Khajuraho is a
        group of Hindu temples and Jain temples in Chhatarpur district, Madhya
        Pradesh, India. Khajuraho temples were built of sandstone on a granite
        foundation and dedicated to Hinduism and Jainism. Khajuraho temples was
        entirely inspired by the Hindu temple design, following a grid of
        geometrical design called vastu-purusha-mandala. The Khajuraho temples
        are not constructed as step pyramids like Rong Chen on Phnom Kulen,
        Bakong, Phnom Bakeng, and Prasat Thom at Koh Ker temple. However, some
        Khajuraho temples were built and dedicated to Hindu gods as in Rong Chen
        on Phnom Kulen and other temples of Angkor region. Kaifeng City (China:
        10th century C.E.): Kaifeng City is constructed many canals to link a
        local river to the yellow river, in east-central Henan province, China.
        It is best known for being the Chinese capital in the Northern Song
        dynasty. Indeed, the new technology of hydraulic power was used to turn
        the water wheel and a water clock. Kaifeng City is surrounded by three
        rings of city walls. Kaifeng was transformed into a major commercial hub
        when it was connected to the grand canal as well as through the
        construction of a canal running to western Shandong, in the early 7th
        century. Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen is also a capital city in
        Cambodia that setups a water management resource system by establishment
        large reservoir and smaller water ponds, dams, and dyke on the hilltop
        of Kulen mountain. <br /><br />
        4. International Machu Picchu (Peru: 15th century C.E.): Machu Picchu is
        an ancient city on the hilltop located in Machu Picchu district,
        Southern Peru. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was
        contracted for the Inca emperor Pachcuti (1438-1472). Machu Picchu was
        built in the classical Inca style with polished dry-stone walls. There
        are three primary structures such as the temple of the sun, the room of
        the three windows and the ritual associated with the calendar.
        Furthermore, Machu Picchu was a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and
        it was voted one of the “New Seven Wonders of the world” in 2007. Machu
        Picchu considered being a royal city for kingship, similar with
        Mahendraparvata on Phnom Kulen. However, it was used for 80 years before
        being abandoned and it was similar used of Mahendraparvata/Phnom Kulen.
        There are more similarities with Cambodia with a royal palace and
        settlements on the hilltop of the mountain. Machu Picchu was used the
        farming done on its hundreds of man-made terraces. They built to ensure
        good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain
        itself from erosion and landslides. On the other hand, it is different
        from Phnom Kulen, the farming done on the hilltop. Chichen Itza (Mexico:
        7th-13th centuries C.E.): Chichen Itza presents a multitude of
        architectural styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. Chichen Itza is the
        largest Maya city and shows densely architecture and residential
        architecture at the site. This site demonstrates a natural sink holes
        with water and some attractive of settlement sites. The town planning of
        Chichen Itza with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the
        site is at least 5 square kilometers. Some greatest effort was put for
        the levelling of the landscape to build the Kukulcan pyramid, grand
        Ballcourt, temple of warriors and El Caracol. The kukulcan temple at
        Chichen Itza was built as a stepped pyramid and serves to showcase an
        ancient light show during every equinox of the Maya.
