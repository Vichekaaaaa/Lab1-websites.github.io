      <h3>Angkor</h3>
      <p>
        Angkor is one of the most important archaeological sites in South-East
        Asia. Stretching over some 400 km2, including forested area, Angkor
        Archaeological Park contains the magnificent remains of the different
        capitals of the Khmer Empire, from the 9th to the 15th century. They
        include the famous Temple of Angkor Wat and, at Angkor Thom, the Bayon
        Temple with its countless sculptural decorations. UNESCO has set up a
        wide-ranging programme to safeguard this symbolic site and its
        surroundings.

      <h3>Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis</h3>
      <p>
        Angkor, in Cambodia’s northern province of Siem Reap, is one of the most
        important archaeological sites of Southeast Asia. It extends over
        approximately 400 square kilometres and consists of scores of temples,
        hydraulic structures (basins, dykes, reservoirs, canals) as well as
        communication routes. For several centuries Angkor, was the centre of
        the Khmer Kingdom. With impressive monuments, several different ancient
        urban plans and large water reservoirs, the site is a unique
        concentration of features testifying to an exceptional civilization.
        Temples such as Angkor Wat, the Bayon, Preah Khan and Ta Prohm,
        exemplars of Khmer architecture, are closely linked to their
        geographical context as well as being imbued with symbolic significance.
        The architecture and layout of the successive capitals bear witness to a
        high level of social order and ranking within the Khmer Empire. Angkor
        is therefore a major site exemplifying cultural, religious and symbolic
        values, as well as containing high architectural, archaeological and
        artistic significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The park is inhabited, and many villages, some of whom the ancestors are
        dating back to the Angkor period are scattered throughout the park. The
        population practices agriculture and more specifically rice cultivation.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Criterion (i):</strong> The Angkor complex represents the entire
        range of Khmer art from the 9th to the 14th centuries, and includes a
        number of indisputable artistic masterpieces (e.g. Angkor Wat, the
        Bayon, Banteay Srei). <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (ii):</strong> The influence of Khmer art as developed
        at Angkor was a profound one over much of South-east Asia and played a
        fundamental role in its distinctive evolution. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iii):</strong> The Khmer Empire of the 9th-14th
        centuries encompassed much of South-east Asia and played a formative
        role in the political and cultural development of the region. All that
        remains of that civilization is its rich heritage of cult structures in
        brick and stone. <br /><br />
        <strong>Criterion (iv):</strong> Khmer architecture evolved largely from
        that of the Indian sub-continent, from which it soon became clearly
        distinct as it developed its own special characteristics, some
        independently evolved and others acquired from neighboring cultural
        traditions. The result was a new artistic horizon in oriental art and
        architecture.
      </p>
      <h4>Integrity</h4>
      <p>
        The Angkor complex encompasses all major architectural buildings and
        hydrological engineering systems from the Khmer period and most of these
        “barays” and canals still exist today. All the individual aspects
        illustrate the intactness of the site very much reflecting the splendor
        of the cities that once were. The site integrity however, is put under
        dual pressures: <br /><br />
        1.endogenous: exerted by more than 100,000 inhabitants distributed over
        112 historic settlements scattered over the site, who constantly try to
        expand their dwelling areas; <br />
        2.exogenous: related to the proximity of the town of Siem Reap, the seat
        of the province and a tourism hub.
      </p>
      <h4>Authenticity</h4>
      <p>
        Previous conservation and restoration works at Angkor between 1907 and
        1992, especially by the École Française d’Extrême-Orient (EFEO), the
        Archaeological Survey of India, the Polish conservation body PKZ, and
        the World Monuments Fund have had no significant impact on the overall
        authenticity of the monuments that make up the Angkor complex and do not
        obtrude upon the overall impression gained from individual monuments.
      </p>
      <h4>Protection and management requirements</h4>
      <p>
        The property is legally protected by the Royal Decree on the Zoning of
        the Region of Siem Reap/Angkor adopted on 28 May 1994 and the Law on the
        protection of the natural and cultural heritage promulgated on 25
        January 1996, the Royal Decree on the creation of the APSARA National
        Authority (Authority for the protection of the site and the management
        of the Angkor Region) adopted on 19 February 1995, the No. 70 SSR
        government Decision, dated 16 September 2004 providing for land‐use in
        the Angkor Park: “All lands located in zone 1 and 2 of the Angkor site
        are State properties”, and the sub-decree No. 50 ANK/BK on the
        organisation and functioning of the APSARA National Authority adopted on
        9 May 2008, specifically provided for the establishment of a Department
        of Land‐use and Habitat Management in the Angkor Park. <br /><br />
        In order to strengthen and to clarify the ownership and building codes
        in the protected zones 1 and 2, boundary posts have been put in 2004 and
        2009 and the action was completed in 2012. <br /><br />
        As off 1993, the ICC-Angkor (International Coordinating Committee for
        the Safeguarding and Development of the historic site of Angkor) created
        on 13 October 1993, ensures the coordination of the successive
        scientific, restoration and conservation related projects, executed by
        the Royal Cambodian Government and its international partners. It
        ensures the consistency of the various projects, and defines, when
        necessary, technical and financial standards and calls the attention of
        all the concerned parties when required. It also contributes to the
        overall management of the property and its sustainable development.
        <br /><br />
        The successful conservation of the property by the APSARA National
        Authority, monitored by the ICC-Angkor, was crowned by the removal of
        the property from the World Heritage List in danger in 2004.
        <br /><br />
        Angkor is one of the largest archaeological sites in operation in the
        world. Tourism represents an enormous economic potential but it can also
        generate irreparable destructions of the tangible as well as intangible
        cultural heritage. Many research projects have been undertaken, since
        the international safeguarding program was first launched in 1993.The
        scientific objectives of the research (e.g. anthropological studies on
        socio-economic conditions) result in a better knowledge and
        understanding of the history of the site, and its inhabitants that
        constitute a rich exceptional legacy of the intangible heritage. The
        purpose is to associate the “intangible culture” to the enhancement of
        the monuments in order to sensitize the local population to the
        importance and necessity of its protection and preservation and assist
        in the development of the site as Angkor is a living heritage site where
        Khmer people in general, but especially the local population, are known
        to be particularly conservative with respect to ancestral traditions and
        where they adhere to a great number of archaic cultural practices that
        have disappeared elsewhere. The inhabitants venerate the temple deities
        and organize ceremonies and rituals in their honor, involving prayers,
        traditional music and dance. Moreover, the Angkor Archaeological Park is
        very rich in medicinal plants, used by the local population for
        treatment of diseases. The plants are prepared and then brought to
        different temple sites for blessing by the gods. The Preah Khan temple
        is considered to have been a university of medicine and the NeakPoan an
        ancient hospital. These aspects of intangible heritage are further
        enriched by the traditional textile and basket weaving practices and
        palm sugar production, which all result in products that are being sold
        on local markets and to the tourists, thus contributing to the
        sustainable development and livelihood of the population living in and
        around the World Heritage site. <br /><br />
        A Public Investigation Unit was created as « measure instrument » for
        identifying the needs, expectations and behaviors of visitors in order
        to set policies, monitor its evolution, prepare a flux management policy
        and promote the unknown sites. <br /><br />
        The management of the Angkor Site, which is inhabited, also takes into
        consideration the population living in the property by associating them
        to the tourist economic growth in order to strive for sustainable
        development and poverty reduction. <br /><br />
        Two major contributions supporting the APSARA National Authority in this
        matter are: <br /><br />
        1. The Angkor Management Plan (AMP) and Community Development
        Participation Project (CDPP), a bilateral cooperation with the
        Government of New Zealand. The AMP helps the APSARA National Authority
        to reorganize and strengthen the institutional aspects, and the CDPP
        prepares the land use map with an experimental participation of the
        communities and supports small projects related to tourist development
        in order to improve the income of villagers living in the protected
        zones; <br />
        2. The Heritage Management Framework composed of a Tourism Management
        Plan and a Risk map on monuments and natural resources; a multilateral
        cooperation with the Government of Australia and UNESCO. Preliminary
        analytical and planning work for the management strategy will take into
        account the necessity to preserve the special atmosphere of Angkor. All
        decisions must guarantee physical, spiritual, and emotional
        accessibility to the site for the visitors. <br />
